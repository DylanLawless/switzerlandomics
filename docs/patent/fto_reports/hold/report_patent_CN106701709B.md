#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The invention discloses ATM gene mutants and applications thereof, in particular to an isolated nucleic acid encoding an ATM gene mutant, an isolated polypeptide, a method for screening biological samples susceptible to ataxia telangiectasia, and screening for ataxia susceptible A system of biological samples for telangiectasia and a kit for screening biological samples susceptible to ataxia telangiectasia. Wherein, the isolated nucleic acid encoding an ATM gene mutant, compared with SEQ ID NO: 1, has at least one mutation selected from the group consisting of: c.4777-2A>T, c.3078G>T, c.7983_7985delTGT and c.477_481delATCTC. By detecting whether the mutant is present in a biological sample, whether the biological sample is susceptible to ataxia telangiectasia can be effectively detected."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses specific novel ATM gene mutations and related methods/kits/systems for screening biological samples for susceptibility to ataxia telangiectasia.
- The patent covers nucleic acids encoding ATM mutants, corresponding polypeptides carrying specific mutations, and detection kits using primers or probes targeting these mutations.
- The method involves sequencing (especially exome sequencing or PCR-based enrichment) for detecting variants and comparing with a reference ATM gene sequence.
- The technology involves analyzing mutations in a specific gene (ATM) known to cause a rare autosomal recessive disorder.
- PCR amplification, sequencing, alignment, and variant detection steps are described.
- The focus is on presence/absence of known pathogenic mutations to identify carrier or affected status.
- Use of specific mutation-specific primers and probes for targeted detection.
- The patent elaborates on identifying compound heterozygous mutations in ATM related to disease.

#### Key Differences

- Quant focuses on estimating genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants and integrating observed/missing variant data to compute Bayesian posteriors for a complete genetic diagnosis across all human genes and inheritance modes.
- The patent focuses exclusively on ATM gene and a handful of specific mutations with methods to detect their presence in biological samples, aiming at screening for susceptibility to one specific genetic disease.
- Quant’s core novelty is statistical modeling of likelihoods including false negatives and inference of diagnostic certainty with credible intervals — this patent does not disclose Bayesian or probabilistic modeling for disease diagnosis confidence.
- The patent does not relate to genome-wide analysis or integration of prior probabilities from population allele frequencies across many genes.
- The patent method is straightforward mutation detection (sequencing or PCR with mutation-specific primers) and comparing with wild-type reference sequence; no integration of variant pathogenicity scores or false negative probabilities.
- Patent does not mention integrating population databases or variant pathogenicity classifiers in a Bayesian framework.
- The patent’s focus is defining novel mutations and their detection in ATM to diagnose or predict ataxia telangiectasia but does not provide a generalized probabilistic disease probability platform.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.  
This patent concerns identifying specific ATM mutations and detecting them for diagnostic/screening use in one disease context without probabilistic modeling of prior probabilities or Bayesian integration of observed/missing variant data as in Quant.

# Short summary:

The patent is narrowly directed at specific mutations in ATM gene and their use for screening ataxia telangiectasia by detecting these mutations. Quant’s innovation in genome-wide Bayesian disease probability estimation integrating prior probabilities, false negative modeling, and multi-inheritance mode analysis is not disclosed by or overlapping with this patent’s teaching.
