#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "本発明者らは、J.R.テリアの消化管腫瘍の病態が、APC遺伝子を原因遺伝子とするヒトの遺伝性疾患である家族性大腸腺腫症に類似していることに着目し、本疾患の罹患犬にAPC遺伝子のc.462A>T及びc.463A>Tの生殖細胞系列変異が認められることを発見した。この変異の検出により、当該疾患の遺伝子検査及び確定診断が可能となる。"

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both the patent and Quant involve genetic diagnosis related to identifying disease-causing variants.
- The patent discloses detection of specific germline mutations (c.462A>T and c.463A>T) in the APC gene for diagnosing hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasia in dogs.
- The patent describes using nucleic acid samples, PCR amplification, and various mutation detection methods (including direct sequencing and probe/primer hybridization).
- The patent claims cover detecting these specific mutations from nucleic acid samples, confirming disease presence or high risk states.
- The invention is applied clinically for definitive diagnosis and risk assessment based on presence/absence of specific pathogenic variants.

#### Key Differences

- Quant is a genome-wide Bayesian variant probability platform integrating prior probabilities and observed/missing variant data to estimate the **probability confidence of a complete genetic diagnosis**, explicitly modeling false negatives and credible intervals.
- This patent focuses narrowly on **detection of two specific known germline mutations** in a single gene (APC) associated with a canine hereditary tumor.
- The patent does **not describe integrating variant frequencies, prior probabilities, modes of inheritance, or Bayesian posterior computations** for diagnosis confidence.
- It does not address genome-wide variant analysis, nor integrates false negative probabilities or uncertainty quantification.
- The patent uses classical molecular genetic methods and mutation detection but lacks the probabilistic, genome-wide, or Bayesian diagnostic framework of Quant.
- Quant’s novelty lies in quantifying diagnostic certainty over the entire genome, rather than detecting specific mutations for single-gene diagnosis as here.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

This patent pertains solely to detecting specific APC mutations in dogs for diagnosis of a particular hereditary neoplasia. It does not disclose or suggest the genome-wide Bayesian framework, integration of prior probabilities, modeling of false negatives, or posterior probability calculations that define Quant’s distinctive method of quantifying diagnostic certainty. Therefore, there is no technical blocking overlap.
