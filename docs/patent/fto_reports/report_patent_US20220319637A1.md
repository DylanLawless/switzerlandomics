#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A method for genome analysis is provided. The method includes receiving a nucleotide string comprising a plurality of nucleotides from at least a portion of one or more individual patients' genome. The method also includes identifying a plurality of variants in said nucleotide string, assigning each identified variant a score based on a location of a variant and a predicted functional consequence, and determining a strength of a variation responsible for a trait or phenotypic manifestation of the variants. The method also includes identifying at least one phenotype, and displaying, in a graphic unit interface of a client device, said nucleotide string, the identified variants, and the at least one phenotype, in one or more genetic elements for one or more individual patients."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Identification of variants in patient genomes, including coding and non-coding regions.
- Scoring of variants based on location and predicted functional consequences (e.g., using algorithms such as Shapiro-Senapathy, MaxEntScan, NNSplice).
- Identification of phenotype/disease/drug response associations based on variant strength or impact.
- Visualization/reporting of genomic data including mutations, genes, alleles, zygosity, mode of inheritance (MOI), domains, pathways, pharmacogenomics, etc., for clinical decision support.
- Use of cohort and family genomic analyses including inheritance patterns, zygosity, and gene signatures.
- Consideration of broad genetic elements including promoters, enhancers, silencers, splice sites (real and cryptic), untranslated regions (5' UTR, 3' UTR), poly-A sites, non-coding RNAs, and dark matter genomic regions.
- Reporting of variant pathogenicity following ACMG guidelines.
- Analysis of drug metabolizing genes (pharmacogenomics) and prediction of drug response phenotypes.
- Integration of structural variation data including copy number variants, gene fusions, and rearrangements.
- Use of large-scale cohort and clinical trial data for genotype-phenotype correlations.
- Utilization of multiple visualization methods for genomic and clinical data (pathogenome and pathogene visualizations).
- Reporting of credible disease gene signatures and gene panels for diagnosis and therapy.
- Inclusion of statistical analyses on mutation frequency, affected pathways, domains, and drug response phenotypes.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on variant scoring, annotation, and visualization, integrating a complex user interface for clinical genomic decision support.
- It emphasizes comprehensive genome-wide analyses of mutations in coding and regulatory elements with publicly known algorithms to assess splicing and regulatory impact.
- The visualization platform aggregates multidimensional data but does not explicitly describe the novel Bayesian integration of prior probabilities with observed/missing variant data to generate genome-wide **posterior probabilities of complete genetic diagnosis** accounting for TP, FP, TN, and FN.
- Although the patent uses pathogenicity scoring and variant impact predictions, it does not disclose a framework comparable to Quant’s unique integration of allele frequency-based prior probabilities and explicit false negative modeling to compute credible intervals of diagnostic certainty.
- The patent appears more oriented toward detailed variant interpretation, phenotype association, and presentation layers rather than the particular probabilistic modeling of genetic diagnosis certainty employed by Quant.
- Methods like the Shapiro-Senapathy algorithm for splice site scoring and cohort/gene signature analysis are mentioned, but not in the precise context of Bayesian posterior probability computation using TP/FN modeling.
- The Bayesian framework for quantifying diagnostic confidence or probability of a **complete diagnosis** (not just variant pathogenicity) is not described.
- Quant’s distinctive quantitative fusion of prior probabilities from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, inheritance modes, and sequencing-related false negative probabilities to produce genome-wide likelihoods is not apparently present.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

While this patent shares overlapping technical domains of comprehensive variant identification, functional scoring, cohort/family analysis, and clinical genomic visualization, it does not disclose the core innovative concept underpinning Quant — namely, the rigorous Bayesian integration of genome-wide prior probabilities with patient-specific observed/missing variant data to compute posterior probabilities quantifying the confidence of a **complete genetic diagnosis**, explicitly modeling TP, FP, TN, and FN rates. The patent’s focus on variant scoring and display, even if extensive, is insufficient to constitute blocking overlap with Quant’s novel Bayesian diagnostic certainty framework.
