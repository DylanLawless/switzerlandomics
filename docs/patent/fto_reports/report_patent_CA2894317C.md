#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Systems and methods that receive as input a DNA or RNA sequence, extract features, and apply layers of processing units to compute one or more condition-specific cell variables, corresponding to cellular quantities measured under different conditions... The change in the condition-specific cell variables are used to compute a score for how deleterious a variant is, to classify a variant's level of deleteriousness, to prioritize variants for subsequent processing, and to compare a test variant to variants of known deleteriousness."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of a deep neural network (DNN) with at least two layers to compute condition-specific cell variables from DNA/RNA sequences containing variants and corresponding reference sequences.
- Evaluation of variant-induced changes by comparing predicted cell variables from variant and reference sequences.
- Use of variant features including nucleotide sequence, RNA secondary structure, nucleosome positioning, and other genomic features.
- Scoring variants based on computed changes in cellular-level variables to prioritize and classify variants' potential deleteriousness.
- Ability to score novel variants and compare to known variants via a computed distance metric between variant-induced changes.
- Generation of a single numerical variant score by combining changes across multiple conditions/tissues.
- Methods to interpret which features contribute most to variant effect predictions.
- Use of autoencoders, and convolutional/recurrent neural networks (e.g., LSTMs) for feature extraction and model architecture.
- Training with multitask learning frameworks to predict probabilistic or real-valued outputs related to splicing or other cellular variables.
- Capability to evaluate the effect of therapies or edited sequences by modeling modifications on variant sequences.

#### Key Differences

- The patent is focused on deep learning to predict *cell variables* (e.g., splicing levels) affected by variants, aiming to score variant deleteriousness as an intermediate step toward phenotype or disease risk prediction.
- While this approach models variant effects in a complex biological context, it does **not explicitly model or integrate prior probabilities of observing pathogenic variants in genes genome-wide under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium**, nor does it address integration of observed and unobserved (false negative) variant data to **compute Bayesian posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis**.
- The patent focuses on *variant classification and prioritization* through learned patterns of variant-induced cellular changes, without quantifying diagnostic confidence intervals or providing a formal Bayesian probability framework integrating TP, FP, FN, TN for diagnosis certainty.
- The patent describes a scoring system for variant deleteriousness and ranking by model outputs but does not describe combining these with inheritance mode priors or patient-level observed versus missing variant calls in a formal probabilistic model.
- The patent does not explicitly model false negative rates or unsequenced regions impacting diagnosis probability.
- Does not explicitly provide genome-wide prior probability calculations of pathogenic variant occurrence per gene.
- The notion of credible intervals or posterior probability that a patient harbors a pathogenic variant is absent.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

The patent describes a sophisticated neural network-based system for scoring variant effects via predicted changes in cellular variables, which is a feature-level pathogenicity classifier. However, it lacks the core theoretical and practical innovations unique to Quant, namely integration of genome-wide prior probabilities, explicit modeling of false negatives and observed variants, and the Bayesian derivation of posterior diagnostic probabilities with credible intervals. Quantâ€™s unique method of quantifying diagnostic confidence beyond variant scoring is not disclosed or suggested in this patent.
