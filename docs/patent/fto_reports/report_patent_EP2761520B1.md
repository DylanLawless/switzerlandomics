#### Abstract (excerpt)

> NA (No explicit abstract present; analysis based on detailed description and claims)

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent describes a computer-implemented method and system that ranks possible genetic diseases by integrating:
  - Clinically assessed phenotypes of a subject.
  - Analysis of the subject’s genome, including identification of genetic changes vs. reference genomes.
  - Assigning weight scores to identified variants based on predetermined criteria including pathogenicity, variant frequency, segregation in family members, evolutionary conservation, type of variant, patterns of inheritance, and statistical genetic association analyses such as Bayesian analysis, LOD score, or TDT.
  - Searching a database linking genetic diseases to genomic loci and phenotypic features.
  - Adjusting an initial phenotype-based ranking of diseases based on genetic variant scoring, resulting in a re-ranked (second) list of candidate diseases.

- The method includes encryption steps to restrict access to raw variant data and ensure privacy, performing ranking without revealing specific variant identities to clinicians initially.

- Uses Bayesian methods as one of several statistical approaches to assess the strength of association of variants with disease at the population/family level.

- Incorporates variant pathogenicity weighting and integration with phenotypic data to prioritize diagnoses.

- The system can use diverse phenotypic data inputs including clinical phenotypes, transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles.

- Genetic variant weighting considers known pathogenic mutations, novel mutations in known genes, involvement in pathways, conservation, family segregation, etc.

- The method thus combines genotype and phenotype data, variant pathogenicity scoring, and database searching/ranking.

#### Key Differences

- Quant’s core novelty is in **genome-wide prior probability models** estimating **probabilities of observing pathogenic variants per gene**, integrating these priors with observed or missing data (false negatives/positives) **to compute Bayesian posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis with uncertainty (credible intervals)**.

- In contrast, this patent focuses on **ranking candidate diseases based on phenotypic similarity adjusted by weighted variant scores**, with variant weights assigned by predefined criteria and statistical associations.

- While Bayesian analysis is mentioned, it is one of several optional statistical methods to weight variants; no explicit modeling of genome-wide priors or false negative variant calls is described.

- The patent does not explicitly quantify or model uncertainty of diagnostic certainty incorporating false negatives or genome-wide variant observation probabilities under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

- Emphasis is on phenotype-driven ranking of diseases adjusted by genotype data; Quant emphasizes probabilistic modeling of diagnosis confidence integrating priors and variant calling uncertainties.

- The system uses encrypted genomes and restricts variant-level user access, a privacy-related feature not highlighted as unique in Quant.

- The Bayesian analyses cited relate to cosegregation or association statistics, rather than posterior probability calculations of diagnosis integrating prior observation probabilities and false negatives.

- The patent’s claims cover assigning weighted scores to variants for ranking diseases, but do not claim probabilistic integration of FN/TP/TN/FP at a genome-wide level.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant. 

**Rationale:** While both approaches integrate genotype and phenotype for diagnosis, the patented method centers on weighted scoring of variants for disease ranking without implementing genome-wide prior probability modeling of variant observation, explicit Bayesian posterior estimation of diagnosis probability with false negative assessment, or credible intervals on diagnosis certainty — all key novel aspects of Quant. The use of Bayesian methods here is limited to traditional statistical association/co-segregation analyses, not the advanced Bayesian diagnosis confidence modeling unique to Quant.
