#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Provided herein are methods, assays and compositions that permit the selection of a treatment for a cancer, classifying a cancer subject into responsive and non-responsive subgroups, and determining reduced function of the BRCA1 pathway in a cancer cell to allow prediction of the response of the cell to certain types of cancer treatments."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses a method of assaying expression of a defined combination of at least ~60 gene markers (e.g., genes such as EZR, SOX4, EMG1, NARS, SNRNP70, CLTA, EIF3B, EIF3E, UBAP2L, SF3A3, among others) in a cancer cell sample.
- It describes calculating a metagene value representing the normalized expression of these markers by linear combination (coefficient=1 for each marker).
- Increased metagene expression compared to a reference is used to determine reduced BRCA1 pathway function and to select subjects sensitive to combined treatment with a PARP inhibitor and a DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutic (e.g., olaparib + temozolomide).
- The patent emphasizes classification of cancer subjects by expression profiles to predict and guide therapy.
- The patent covers gene expression assays, including mRNA and protein levels, normalized to control genes, using arrays and multiplex formats.
- The claims focus on using this gene expression metagene and normalized expression thresholds for treatment decisions.
- This overlaps with Quant’s use of a gene-level probability or risk metric to predict clinically actionable states—in this case, cancer treatment sensitivity linked to BRCA1 pathway status.
- Use of a metagene derived from a defined set of genes, linear combination with equal weighting, and normalization closely resembles Quant’s metagene calculation approach described for genetic diagnosis confidence.
- Both integrate observed evidence (here gene expression) with statistical thresholds (reference comparison) to derive actionable treatment decisions.
- The patent includes extensive lists of genes assayed overlapping at least partially with Quant’s data inputs for expression/variant interpretation.
- Both address cancer diagnostics relevant to BRCA1 pathway functional deficiency leading to treatment decisions, albeit with different outputs (treatment selection vs. genetic diagnosis confidence).

#### Key Differences

- The patent’s main focus is on gene expression profiling of cancer samples to predict BRCA1 pathway deficiency and suitability for combined PARP inhibitor/chemotherapy treatment.
- Quant centers on genome-wide variant probability integration — using variant allele frequencies, inheritance mode, and assessment of true positive and false negative variant observations to produce Bayesian posterior probabilities of pathogenic variant presence and diagnostic certainty.
- Quant’s core innovation is integrating prior probabilities with observed/missing variants for genetic diagnosis confidence intervals—rather than classifying gene expression patterns for drug response.
- The patent does not disclose a probabilistic Bayesian model incorporating variant data, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, or false negative variant probabilities as Quant does.
- The patent’s use of expression-based metagene scoring is conceptually a different modality than Quant’s variant-centric probability modeling.
- The patent focuses on prediction of chemotherapeutic sensitivity (treatment selection), while Quant focuses on numerical confidence in genetic diagnosis from variant data.
- The patent emphasizes gene expression platform assays (arrays, multiplex PCR), whereas Quant encompasses variant frequency data integration across genome-wide loci.
- Although both employ linear combinations (equal coefficients) of gene measurements, the patent claims and examples do not describe integrating prior expectations with observed/missing patient-specific variant data.
- Quant’s innovation includes posterior probability distributions and credible intervals quantifying diagnostic certainty, which the patent lacks.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** While this patent uses a defined gene set and metagene expression value normalized to controls to predict BRCA1 pathway deficiency and guide combinatorial PARP inhibitor plus DNA damage- inducing chemotherapy, it does not describe genome-wide Bayesian integration of prior variant probabilities with observed and false negative variant data to assess diagnostic confidence as implemented by Quant. The overlap is at the level of use of gene expression metagenes for cancer treatment selection, which is modality-distinct from Quant’s variant-level Bayesian diagnostic certainty framework. Therefore, this patent does not block Quant’s core innovation.
