#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A method for genome analysis is provided. The method includes receiving a nucleotide string comprising a plurality of nucleotides from at least a portion of one or more individual patients' genome. The method also includes identifying a plurality of variants in said nucleotide string, assigning each identified variant a score based on a location of a variant and a predicted functional consequence, and determining a strength of a variation responsible for a trait or phenotypic manifestation of the variants... A system and a non-transitory, computer-readable medium storing instructions to perform the above method are also provided."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses a broad genome analysis platform that identifies variants across a wide range of genomic elements including 5'-UTRs, promoters, enhancers, silencers, exons, introns, splice sites, branch points, 3'-UTRs, poly-A sites, and cryptic versions of these elements, consistent with functional genomic annotation.  
- Uses variant scoring based on location and predicted functional consequence. Specifically mentions algorithms like Shapiro-Senapathy, MaxEntScan, and NNSplice for predicting splice site strength or variant impact in regulatory elements.  
- Identifies variants in both coding and non-coding RNA genes.  
- Provides visualization and reports multiple genetic elements, variant consequences, and associated phenotypes such as disease, drug response, therapeutic indications, and adverse effects.  
- Describes modules for variant annotation, cohort analysis, family genomics, gene fusion detection, pharmacogenomics, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability, and clinical reporting.  
- Uses data from public repositories (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC, dbSNP) and incorporates clinical variant guidelines (ACMG).  
- Considers structural variants including CNVs, gene fusions, and rearrangements.  
- Considers zygosity and mode of inheritance in variant interpretation.  
- Includes novel exploration of the “dark matter genome” for genes not yet identified in standard databases.  
- Provides mechanisms for determining variant pathogenicity and impacts on splicing, gene regulation, transcript processing, and protein effects.  
- Reports comprehensive clinical outputs integrating genomic findings with therapeutic and pharmacogenomic insights.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses extensively on scoring and predicting variant functional consequences individually (variant-by-variant pathogenicity), relying on existing motif-scoring algorithms and known clinical variant interpretations.  
- There is no explicit description or claim of integrating prior probabilities with observed or missing variant data to compute a *Bayesian posterior probability* quantifying the confidence that a *complete genetic diagnosis* has been made, accounting for false negatives or incomplete sequencing.  
- The patent focuses on multi-element variant detection and annotation but does not articulate probability modeling incorporating true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and the four possible variant outcome categories (TP, FP, TN, FN) with Bayesian integration for diagnosis confidence.  
- Although it integrates clinical data and variant scoring tools, the patent’s scoring remains largely predictive/classificatory at variant or gene level, without explicitly modeling the genome-wide prior probabilities of pathogenic variant occurrence or inheritance-mode-based prior modeling as a foundation for diagnosis confidence scores.  
- The disclosed system emphasizes annotation, visualization, and cataloging pathogenic mutations, gene signatures, and genomic features, but does not provide a method that explicitly calculates credible intervals or posterior probabilities over the entire genome or gene panel capturing missing variant information or sequencing uncertainty.  
- While the patent mentions a broad suite of modules (gene discovery, cohort, family, clinical trial, pharmacogenomics, rearrangements, pathogenome), these are oriented to variant annotation, frequency, and cohort analyses rather than probabilistic diagnostic certainty modeling.  
- The Bayesian integration of variant prior probabilities with patient-specific observed and unobserved variant data to produce posterior probabilities of *carrying a disease-causing variant* and diagnostic certainty is not delineated.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
This patent provides a comprehensive genomic analysis platform that extensively annotates and scores variants across coding and regulatory regions, supports cohort and family genomics, pharmacogenomics, structural variant detection, and clinical reporting. Its technical focus is on detecting, annotating, scoring variants for pathogenicity using established algorithms (e.g., Shapiro-Senapathy), leveraging known datasets, and providing rich visualization and clinical reports.

However, it lacks the key novel innovation of Quant: the explicit Bayesian modeling framework that integrates genome-wide prior probabilities of pathogenic variant occurrence with observed *and unobserved* variant data in a patient’s genome—accounting for false negatives—to derive posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis with credible intervals of certainty. Quant uniquely models TP, FP, TN, FN variant categories probabilistically across all genes and inheritance modes to quantify diagnostic confidence, a concept absent in this patent.

Accordingly, despite some overlapping terminology and general approach to variant analysis and annotation, this patent does not present a blocking risk to Quant’s core intellectual property.
