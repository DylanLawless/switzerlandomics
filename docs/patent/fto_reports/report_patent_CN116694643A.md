### Reference #1

- **Title:** MPZL2 gene mutant and application thereof
- **Publication No.:** CN116694643A
- **Publication Date:** 2022-04-26

#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention relates to isolated nucleic acids, gene mutations, isolated proteins and their use in the preparation of kits... By detecting whether the isolated nucleic acid exists in the biological sample, it can effectively detect whether the biological sample suffers from autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent relates to detecting specific gene mutations (c.393_436+21del and c.220C>T) on the MPZL2 gene associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness.
- It discloses nucleic acid sequences, specific primers, probes, antibodies, kits, and methods for detecting these mutations via sequencing/PCR.
- The invention includes biological models expressing these mutations for drug screening.
- The core technical concept is identifying pathogenic gene mutations and diagnosing disease by their presence.

#### Key Differences

- The patent is focused on identifying and detecting defined mutations in a specific gene (MPZL2) for diagnostic purposes.
- It does not describe any genome-wide probability calculations, prior probability modeling, or integration of observed/missing variants.
- There is no mention or implementation of Bayesian posterior probabilities combining prior probabilities with patient-specific variant detection.
- The system is mutation-centric—detect presence/absence of specific mutations—not probabilistic or gene-level diagnostic confidence estimations.
- No use or modeling of false negatives, true positives, or credible intervals regarding genetic diagnostic certainty.
- No mention of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium-based variant occurrence probability calculations or genome-wide analyses.
- Technology relates to classical molecular genetics (PCR, sequencing, mutation detection), not advanced statistical or Bayesian frameworks.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:**  
This patent relates exclusively to identifying pathogenic mutations in a single gene for a specific genetic disorder using conventional molecular genetic methods. It does not disclose or suggest integration of prior probabilities with patient variant observations to yield Bayesian posterior probabilities or diagnostic certainty metrics as characterized by Quant. Therefore, there is no close resemblance to Quant’s core innovation around genome-wide Bayesian diagnostic confidence modeling.
