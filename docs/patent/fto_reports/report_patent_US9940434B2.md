#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The method for genome analysis translates the clinical findings in the patient into a comprehensive test order for genes that can be causative of the patient's illness, delimits analysis of variants identified in the patient's genome to those that are “on target” for the patient's illness, and provides clinical annotation of the likely causative variants for inclusion in a variant warehouse that is updated as a result of each sample that is analyzed..."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses comprehensive phenotype-to-disease-to-gene-to-variant mappings to prioritize gene and variant analysis based on patient clinical features.
- Implements a probabilistic framework assigning truth values (weights) to clinical features, diseases, gene variants, and their associations.
- Incorporates Bayesian or probabilistic models for variant classification and genotype interpretation.
- Employs multiple variant detection pipelines and integrates their results to increase variant detection sensitivity.
- Supports self-learning capacity that updates association weights based on accumulating patient data and diagnoses.
- Utilizes standardized vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED-CT, HPO, OMIM) for phenotype and disease description.
- Provides a dynamic, iterative system to refine differential diagnoses and gene/variant prioritization guided by phenotype data.
- Considers problems of missing or incomplete data by weighting phenotypic observations for uncertain or absent symptoms.
- Integrates variant allele frequency and predicted functional impact scores (e.g., SIFT, PolyPhen) into variant pathogenicity assessment.
- Provides tools for variant annotation and classification (RUNES pipeline) and a user interface (VIKING) for filtering and ranking variants relative to phenotype.
- Maps inheritance patterns to aid in variant pathogenicity evaluation.
  
#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses primarily on using clinical features to restrict genomic analysis to relevant genes ("on target genes") and to annotate/prioritize variants accordingly.
- Emphasis is on phenotype-driven gene and variant prioritization rather than explicitly computing genome-wide prior probabilities of observing disease-causing variants.
- Does not explicitly describe integrating prior population-based probabilities (e.g., under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium) with observed patient variant data to compute Bayesian posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis.
- While it discusses probabilistic truth-value assignments, it does not structure the analysis explicitly around observing true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), and calculating credible intervals for diagnostic certainty.
- Variant classification is based on pathogenicity categories (ACMG), allele frequencies, and known mutation databases, but lacks the explicit Bayesian integration framework over observed/missing variants emphasized by Quant.
- The self-learning component updates association weights, but no clear mechanism is described to quantify diagnosis confidence incorporating sequencing sensitivity or false negative probabilities in a Bayesian manner.
- The approach primarily narrows variant lists by phenotypic relevance rather than modeling genome-wide variant occurrence probabilities including missing data.
- Large structural variants and complex rearrangements detection is disclosed but treated separately without a unified probability model that combines various variant types into a single diagnostic certainty metric.
  
#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

The patent describes a comprehensive phenotype-driven genome interpretation framework relying on probabilistic truth values and variant classification but does not disclose or claim the unique Bayesian integration of population-wide variant prior probabilities with patient-specific observed and missing variant data to compute posterior probabilities and credible intervals quantifying confidence in a complete genetic diagnosis. It lacks explicit modeling of TP, FN, and diagnostic uncertainty in the manner that defines Quant’s novelty.
