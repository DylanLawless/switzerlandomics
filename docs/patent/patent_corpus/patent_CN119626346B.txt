All other embodiments, which can be made by those skilled in the art based on the embodiments of the application without making any inventive effort, are intended to be within the scope of the application. FIG. 1 is a flow chart of a pattern recognition method for medical gene sequencing data according to an embodiment of the present application. It is to be understood that, in the field of analysis of gene sequencing data, currently most commonly used tools for sequence alignment and mutation detection include BLAST (Basic Local ALIGNMENT SEARCH Tool), BWA (Burows-WHEELER ALIGNER), GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit), and the like. BLAST uses seed expansion strategy to align sequences, uses fixed length seed sequences (typically 11 bp) as anchor points, and although it is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency, its scoring matrix uses fixed BLOSUM or PAM matrix, and cannot dynamically adjust parameters according to sequence specificity, which results in easy occurrence of false positives when dealing with highly variable regions. BWA relies mainly on the Burrows-Wheeler transform for sequence indexing, and uses a uniform quality threshold (typically Q20 or Q30) for filtering during sequence preprocessing, and fails to consider the influence of local sequence features on quality assessment. In the mutation detection process of the GATK, although a mutation detection algorithm based on a Bayesian model is introduced, the mutation site positioning mainly depends on simple mismatch rate statistics, and independent assumptions are often adopted when adjacent mutation is processed, so that complex associated mutation modes cannot be effectively identified and analyzed. In contrast, the embodiment of the application performs targeted technical improvement and parameter optimization in a plurality of key links. In the sequence preprocessing stage, different from a BWA fixed quality threshold strategy, the embodiment of the application introduces a self-adaptive window mechanism based on local GC content, the window size is dynamically adjusted within the range of 30-45bp, and the base with low quality value is directionally corrected by combining with the Phred algorithm, so that the accuracy of data preprocessing is remarkably improved. And in the sequence comparison algorithm level, the limitation of a BLAST fixed scoring matrix is broken through, and a self-adaptive scoring system based on deep learning is constructed. The system integrates 23-dimensional characteristic information comprising nucleotide types, local GC content, secondary structure prediction and the like through a three-layer neural network (128-64-32 node structure), and realizes accurate scoring of different conservation areas. In particular when processing highly variable regions, the system can be based on the entropy of the information of the sitesAnd evolutionary conservation scoreThe match score and mismatch score are automatically adjusted to reveal a more accurate sequence alignment than the fixed scoring matrix. In the mutation detection and classification links, the embodiment of the application overcomes the defects of GATK and other tools in the process of complex mutation modes. By introducing a scanning mechanism with the size of a 23bp window and the step length of 7bp and combining dynamic adjustment of the GC content threshold by a Gaussian mixture model, the high-precision positioning of the potential variation region is realized. Particularly, when adjacent mutation is processed, a 3×4 base conversion matrix and a correlation mutation analysis mechanism based on a 34bp distance threshold are designed, and when the co-occurrence frequency between the mutation exceeds 0.567 and the sequence characteristic similarity is higher than 0.823, the system can automatically identify the correlation mutation as the correlation mutation and perform unified processing. This approach significantly improves the ability to identify complex mutation patterns. In the final pattern clustering analysis, the more accurate classification and identification of the mutation pattern are realized by constructing 23-dimensional feature vectors comprising mutation type 3-dimensional one-hot codes, position information, length features and the like and introducing a distance weight mechanism based on sequence similarity (the weight is increased by 1.2 times when the similarity is more than 0.845). Not only do these technical innovations overcome the limitations of existing tools in dealing with complex patterns of variation, but a more rapid and reliable framework for analysis of gene sequencing data is also disclosed. As shown in fig. 1, at step S101, a target gene sequence obtained by sequencing is preprocessed, including sequence reading, quality evaluation, pairing and splicing, and length screening, to generate a preprocessed sequence file.

In one embodiment, the sequence of the target gene obtained by sequencing is subjected to data preprocessing. And reading the FASTQ format file output by the sequencer into a memory, establishing a corresponding relation array of base sequences and quality values, extracting three fields of ID identification, base sequences and quality character strings of each sequence, and respectively storing the three fields in the character string array with the length of N, wherein N is the total number of the sequences. And (3) evaluating the sequence quality by adopting a self-adaptive sliding window method, wherein the window size is dynamically adjusted within a range of 30-45bp according to the local GC content, and the step length correspondingly floats within a range of 3-7 bp. When the average magnitude of the homogeneity within the window is below 23, this region is marked as a low quality region. Sequences with sequencing reads less than 67bp or low mass regions exceeding 12% of the total length were filtered. And calculating the mass value of each base by using a Phred algorithm, and correcting the base with the mass value lower than 18. And splicing the paired sequences by utilizing double-end pairing information, wherein the minimum overlapping length is set to be 31bp during splicing, and the allowable mismatch rate is 0.8-0.9%.

Specifically, an improved sequence alignment algorithm model is constructed.

For the highly conserved region, the alignment parameters are dynamically adjusted according to sequence statistics, the matching score ranges from 2.0 to 2.5, the mismatch deduction ranges from-1.5 to-2.0, the gap penalty ranges from-1.8 to-2.3, and for the variable region, the system calculates the corresponding parameter interval through a sequence evolution model. A sparse matrix is used to store a dynamic programming scoring matrix, recording only non-zero elements with scores greater than a threshold. In compressed row storage format, each non-zero element records its column index and score value. By maintaining an index range of the active computation band, invalid computations in the matrix filling process are reduced. The minimum similarity threshold for sequence alignment was set to 87.3% and the maximum allowed gap ratio was set to 3.2%. In the comparison process, an improved backtracking algorithm is adopted, a search space is optimized through setting branch-and-bound conditions, and branches are directly pruned when the local comparison score is lower than a threshold value of 13.7. For sequences with the length exceeding 234bp, a segmentation comparison strategy is adopted, the sequences are divided into a plurality of overlapped subsequences for comparison, the subsequences are 156bp in length, and the overlapping length of adjacent subsequences is 47bp.

In one embodiment, a scoring matrix for the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm is first constructed. E2 gene sequences in a reference sequence library are randomly divided into a training set and a verification set according to the proportion of 78.9%, and sequences in the training set are subjected to multi-sequence comparison to generate an initial position specificity scoring matrix.

For any two sequence alignment positions (i, j), the initial scoring value is passedIntegration is performed with the nucleotide composition feature vector within the 29bp window of the local sequence context. For each site, features including nucleotide type, local GC content, secondary structure prediction score, etc. are extracted, and a 23-dimensional feature vector is constructed.

The network realizes a differential scoring strategy for different conservation areas by integrating 23-dimensional characteristics such as nucleotide types, local GC content, secondary structure prediction scores and the like. Specifically, the system dynamically adjusts scoring parameters based on the information entropy (H i) and the evolutionary conservation score (C i) of the locus, identifying the locus as a highly conserved region when C i is below 0.537 and H i is below 0.682, using a higher matching score (2.37) and a stricter mismatch score (-1.83), and using a more flexible parameter setting for the variable region (C i is above 0.892 or H i is above 1.237). In terms of mutation site detection and classification, the embodiment of the application establishes a set of multi-level analysis framework. The sequence difference is scanned by a sliding window method (the window size is 23bp, the step length is 7 bp), and the GC content threshold interval is dynamically determined by combining a Gaussian mixture model, so that the accurate positioning of the potential variation region is realized. In the mutation classification process, a 3×4 base conversion matrix and an associated mutation analysis mechanism are introduced, and the accurate identification of the complex mutation mode is realized by analyzing the distance between mutation areas (threshold 34 bp) and the co-occurrence characteristic (frequency threshold 0.567).
