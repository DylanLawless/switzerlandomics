#### Abstract (excerpt)

> No standard abstract available. The invention relates to a computer-implemented method for determining phenotypic effects of molecular variants identified in biological samples, involving receiving molecular variants associated with functional elements within a model system comprising single cells or cellular compartments; determining molecular or phenotypic scores; deriving molecular, phenotypic, and population signals; utilizing statistical learning techniques (including machine learning and neural networks) to associate these signals with variant phenotypic effects; and generating evidence scores or classifications based on functional, predictor, and hotspot models. The system also includes methods for evaluating and optimizing evidence datasets using multiple statistical measures, and leveraging multi-level variant interpretation engines.

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of statistical learning, including regression, classification, and neural networks, to predict or classify variant phenotypic effects.
- Modeling and deriving functional scores, predictor scores, and hotspot scores for molecular variants.
- Incorporation of population signals and molecular signals from single-cell or compartmental measurements.
- Use of evidence datasets that include multiple types of variant annotations and classification confidence metrics such as true positive rate, positive predictive value, etc.
- Machine learning models are applied to associate complex molecular and phenotypic data with variant effects.
- Reference to deriving variant classification scores and evidence scores based on multi-level variant interpretation engines.
- Adoption of evaluation metrics including true positive rate, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratios — these overlap with measures like TP, FN, etc. used in Quant for model performance assessment.
- Attention to integrating multi-dimensional molecular signals (gene expression, chromatin state, mutation burden) for variant effect prediction.

#### Key Differences

- The patent primarily focuses on scoring the phenotypic effects of molecular variants using machine learning models applied to multi-compartmental molecular and phenotypic data at single-cell resolution.
- It emphasizes deriving variant-level functional and evidence scores from molecular/phenotypic signals via statistical learning.
- The approach concentrates on variant effect prediction or classification rather than on genome-wide prior probabilities or Bayesian posterior probabilities of genetic diagnosis certainty.
- The patent does not describe integrating prior probabilities of disease-causing variant observation with patient-specific observed or missing variant evidence to compute a Bayesian diagnostic posterior probability—the core novel feature of Quant.
- The patent describes models to generate evidence scores/classifications from variant-level molecular signals, not about aggregating variant evidence by gene or genome-wide, nor explicitly modeling false negatives or unobserved variants in patient data.
- The scope centers on machine learning-driven phenotypic impact prediction rather than probabilistic confidence quantification of a complete genetic diagnosis.
- No explicit mention of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium calculations or integration of prior variant observation probabilities with clinical diagnostic uncertainty quantification.
- Does not provide methods for computing credible intervals that quantify uncertainty in diagnostic confidence.
- Focus on phenotypic impact scoring for molecular variants, including use of multi-state molecular signals and clustering techniques, diverges from Quant’s genome-wide diagnostic scoring paradigm.
- The patent's emphasis is on functional scoring engines, variant interpretation engines, and molecular signal integration rather than Bayesian frameworks combining variant priors with observed/missing call data.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
While JP2020524350A5 discloses advanced machine learning-based methods to predict or score phenotypic impacts of molecular variants, including using TP, FP, PPV, NPV, and other statistical measures to evaluate classifier performance, it differs substantively from Quant’s core innovation. Quant uniquely focuses on genome-wide calculation of prior probabilities of pathogenic variant occurrence under genetic population models, integration of this prior with patient-specific sequencing data (including unobserved false negatives), and computation of Bayesian posterior probabilities quantifying confidence in a complete genetic diagnosis with credible intervals. The patent does not disclose combining prior population-genetic likelihoods with observed/missing genotype data in a Bayesian manner to infer diagnostic certainty, nor modeling the false negative rates in sequencing data as part of the diagnostic probability calculation. These distinctions render the patent non-blocking relative to Quant’s specific novel technology.
