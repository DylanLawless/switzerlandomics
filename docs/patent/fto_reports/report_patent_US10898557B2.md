#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention relates to peptides, proteins, nucleic acids and cells for use in immunotherapeutic methods. In particular, the present invention relates to the immunotherapy of cancer. The present invention furthermore relates to tumor-associated T-cell peptide epitopes ... that can for example serve as active pharmaceutical ingredients of vaccine compositions that stimulate anti-tumor immune responses, or to stimulate T cells ex vivo and transfer into patients."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens presented by MHC molecules as immunotherapeutics.
- Discloses specific peptides (SEQ ID NO: 1 to 388) identified from tumors including lung cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and other cancers.
- Methods involve generating T cells activated against these peptide-MHC complexes and using them for adoptive cell therapy.
- Includes in vitro T-cell priming, immunogenicity assays, MHC binding assays, and peptide synthesis steps.
- Peptides are identified on tumor tissues by mass spectrometry and tested for immunogenicity and MHC-binding, similar to Quant’s input data acquisition steps.
- Discusses the use of these peptides and T cells therapeutically to achieve cancer treatment, including generating credible immunotherapy products.
- Emphasis on tumor specificity and over-presentation to minimize targeting of normal tissue.
- Methods include detailed protocols for peptide synthesis, identification, quantitation, and T-cell activation, resembling Quant’s pipeline for variant data integration and probabilistic interpretation of presentation.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses solely on immunotherapy using tumor-specific peptides and adoptive T-cell transfer or vaccines, rather than genetic diagnosis or estimation of disease-causing variant probabilities.
- Quant’s innovation lies in genome-wide calculation of Bayesian posterior probabilities of pathogenic variants integrating prior population genetics and observed/missing variant data (TP, FN).
- Quant does not involve or claim cancer immunotherapy, peptide identification, or T-cell based treatments.
- No mention or teaching regarding Bayesian integration of variant allele frequencies, false negatives, or diagnostic certainty assessments as in Quant.
- The data inputs, while including mass spectrometry and gene expression, relate to peptide immunogenicity rather than variant pathogenicity probability estimation.
- The patent’s focus is on therapeutic use of immune responses targeting peptide-MHC complexes, not on genome-wide genetic variant interpretation or diagnosis confidence metrics.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
This patent discloses cancer immunotherapy methods based on tumor-associated peptides identified via mass spectrometry and gene expression analysis, used to generate T cell therapies and vaccines. Although there is overlap on data types (e.g., gene expression, peptide identification), it is purely in the immunotherapy domain, focusing on peptides and T cell activation. Quant’s technology is fundamentally different, focusing on probabilistic genetic diagnosis through Bayesian integration of variant observation and false negative data across inheritance modes. The patent does not describe or suggest Quant’s technical method of calculating genome-wide posterior probabilities for genetic diagnostics. Hence, it is not blocking.
