#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The invention provides methods for estimating haplotype frequencies using an estimating equation method and a forward-block algorithm that provides a standard error measurement for each estimated haplotype frequency... The methods may be used... for estimating a set of haplotype frequencies in a population, for assessing the association of a haplotype with a trait, and for assessing the association of haplotypes for one or more set of markers and one or more environmental factors with a trait."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of estimating equation (EE) methods for estimating haplotype frequencies from genotype data with incomplete phase information.
- Forward-block computational algorithm to scale to large numbers of SNP markers.
- Direct estimation of standard errors for haplotype frequency estimates without bootstrapping.
- Haplotype association testing between cases and controls using statistical models.
- Integration of haplotype frequency estimation and case-control association analysis in an estimating equation statistical framework.
- Consideration of environmental variables and gene-environment interactions in association analyses.
- Application of a Bayesian or likelihood framework for estimating haplotype probabilities given unphased genotypes.
- Use of logistic-type regression models to compute associations between haplotypes, environmental factors, and disease traits.
- Handling of missing genotype data and population-scale SNP datasets (hundreds to thousands of markers).
- Computational strategies for efficiently estimating haplotype frequencies and associations in large genomic datasets.

#### Key Differences

- Does not address genome-wide calculation of prior probabilities of **disease-causing variants** per gene or quantifying false negatives in variant observation.
- Focus is on haplotype frequency estimation and association testing, rather than on variant-level Bayesian posterior probabilities quantifying confidence of a *complete genetic diagnosis*.
- The method focuses on population-level haplotype frequency estimation and statistical testing of trait associations.
- No explicit modeling of inheritance modes on variant observation probabilities under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium as priors.
- Lacks integration of per-patient observed variant data (true positives) with probabilities of unobserved false negatives at variant or gene level.
- Does not produce credible intervals for diagnostic certainty or posterior probabilities of carrying a pathogenic variant.
- Univocal focus on estimation of haplotype frequencies and their associations with traits, not on quantifying diagnostic confidence from both observed and missing variant data.
- The Bayesian component concerns haplotype reconstruction, not Bayesian calculation of diagnosis probabilities for individual genomes.
- The “forward-block” algorithm is tailored to haplotype frequency estimation not to genome-wide variant pathogenicity modeling.
- Does not claim quantification of genome-wide prior probabilities for disease-causing variants or gene-level disease probabilities.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

### Summary of Analysis

This patent is highly technical and has extensive overlap with key statistical and computational methods in genomics for haplotype frequency estimation and association testing using estimating equations and Bayesian concepts. However, the technical focus is on population haplotype frequency estimation, association statistics, and gene/environment interactions. It does not address the core novelty of Quant, which is the integration of genome-wide prior probabilities of **observing disease-causing variants**, modeling of false negatives at the variant and gene level, and direct Bayesian calculation of posterior probabilities of **a complete genetic diagnosis** by combining prior probabilities with observed (and unobserved) variant data.

No claims or descriptions mention estimating confidence or credible intervals of diagnostic certainty by integrating patient-level variant observations with prior probabilities. There is no teaching or suggestion of integrating variant-level prior pathogenicity with inheritance modes to derive genome-wide disease variant observation probabilities, nor is there quantification of false negative probabilities specifically at the individual patient variant call level.

Therefore, while this patent covers methods for genomic haplotype frequency estimation and trait association widely used in genetics, it does not block Quant’s unique framework for Bayesian integration of prior variant disease probabilities with observed/missing variant data to establish diagnostic confidence.
