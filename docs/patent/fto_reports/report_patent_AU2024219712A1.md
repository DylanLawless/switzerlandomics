#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Disclosed herein are system, method, and computer program product embodiments for determining phenotypic impacts of molecular variants identified within a biological sample. Embodiments include receiving molecular variants associated with functional elements within a model system...determine molecular scores...determine functional scores for the molecular variants based on statistical learning...determine phenotypic impacts of the molecular variants..."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent focus on determining phenotypic impacts (pathogenicity or functional consequences) of molecular/genetic variants.
- Use of statistical/machine learning models and neural networks (including autoencoders) to associate molecular measurements or signals with phenotypic impacts.
- Use of multi-dimensional molecular measurements from single cells or other model systems.
- Derivation of functional scores and classifications of variants.
- Application across coding and non-coding regions, and on genes associated with Mendelian disorders, cancer, and pharmacogenomics.
- Dimensionality reduction via neural networks (autoencoders), supervised machine learning to generate functional models.
- Integration of multiple sources of molecular data to improve classification accuracy.

#### Key Differences

- The patent primarily describes a platform focused on detailed experimental and computational profiling of individual molecular variants in model systems using deep mutational scanning combined with high-throughput molecular assays to generate molecular scores, signals, and phenotypic impact classifications.
- Emphasis is on characterizing the molecular and phenotypic consequences at the single-cell or cellular compartment level via multi-omic measurements and experimental perturbation.
- No explicit mention of integrating prior probabilities of variant occurrence genome-wide or incorporating Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium genotype frequency models.
- Does not specifically focus on estimating false negative probabilities or accounting for unobserved variant data in clinical patient genomes to assess diagnostic confidence.
- No explicit use or modeling of true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true negative (TN), or false positive (FP) rates to compute a Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis as Quant does.
- Lacks methods for genome-wide prior probability estimation integrated with patient-specific variant calls and sequencing coverage or missing data.
- Focus is variant-level functional impact prediction and classification; Quant focuses on gene- and patient-level diagnosis probability incorporating population genetics priors and observed/missing variants.
- While both use Bayesian frameworks and machine learning, Quant uniquely models whole-genome diagnostic certainty with credible intervals, not just variant pathogenicity.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:**  
This patent provides a comprehensive framework for variant functional impact interpretation primarily based on deep mutational scanning experimental data integrated with computational models, emphasizing molecular and cellular phenotypic profiling. While it shares use of machine learning, autoencoders, and molecular signals to predict variant pathogenicity, it does **not** disclose or claim methods that combine genome-wide prior variant probabilities with observed patient variant data and explicitly quantify false negative probabilities to generate a Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis, which is the core innovation of Quant.

Therefore, despite surface semantic overlap around variant classification and use of Bayesian/machine learning methods, the conceptual and technical approach differs substantially from Quant's focus on integrating prior probabilities of variant occurrence, inheritance mode modeling, and clinical diagnostic certainty with TP/FN-based posterior calculations.
