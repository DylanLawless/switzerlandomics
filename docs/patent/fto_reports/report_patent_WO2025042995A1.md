#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure provides, among other things, specific doses of an ENPP1 agent for in vivo treatment of an ENPP1 deficiency, such as for treatment of Generalized Arterial Calcification of Infancy (GACI), Hypopyrophosphatemia, Autosomal Recessive Hypophosphatemic Rickets 2 (ARHR2), and other diseases resulting from pathological calcification, ENPP1 deficiency, ABCC6 deficiency such as diseases or disorders involving ectopic calcification of soft tissue in a subject of age 1-12."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses methods and compositions comprising administering an ENPP1 agent (including ENPP1 fusion proteins like ENPP1-Fc) at a dose of approximately 2.4 mg/kg to children aged 1-12 with ENPP1 deficiency, ABCC6 deficiency, or related pathological calcification diseases.
- The treatment aims to restore physiological levels of ENPP1 activity and plasma pyrophosphate (PPi), thereby preventing or reducing pathological vascular and soft tissue calcification.
- The patent details the recombinant production, formulation, and dosing regimens, including once or twice weekly subcutaneous administration.
- The patent also discusses monitoring clinical and biochemical parameters related to bone and vascular health as indicators of therapeutic efficacy.
- The patent’s focus is on enzyme replacement therapy to increase circulating ENPP1 activity and PPi levels for treating genetic mineralization disorders.

#### Key Differences

- The patent relates to therapeutic methods of treating ENPP1 and ABCC6 deficiencies by enzyme replacement to prevent or reduce pathological calcification.
- There is no mention of diagnosing genetic variants, calculating prior probabilities, or integrating observed and unobserved variant data.
- The patent does not discuss or claim any computational framework or Bayesian posterior probability models evaluating the likelihood of pathogenic variants or confidence in genetic diagnoses.
- The focus is solely on protein therapeutics (ENPP1 agents) and dosing for treatment rather than genetic variant probability assessment or data integration.
- The patent does not leverage concepts such as true positives, false negatives, or credible intervals for genetic diagnosis certainty.
- The patent’s scope is biochemical treatment of a rare disease phenotype, not genetic data interpretation or genome-wide probabilistic modeling.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** This patent is directed to therapeutic treatment by administering ENPP1 protein agents to children suffering from ENPP1 or ABCC6 deficiencies causing pathological calcifications. The core innovation lies in enzyme replacement therapy dosing, efficacy, and clinical management. There is no disclosure or claim overlapping with Quant’s unique approach of integrating prior probabilities and observed/missing variant data using Bayesian models to estimate diagnostic certainty in genetic testing. Thus, this patent does not pose a freedom-to-operate barrier for Quant’s genome-wide Bayesian variant probability platform.
