#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure provides a method for genetic analysis disease diagnoses as well as a system for implementing such analysis."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical natural language processing (CNLP) to extract detailed patient phenotypes mapped to standardized vocabularies (e.g., Human Phenotype Ontology).
- Generating a ranked list of potential differential diagnoses by integrating phenotypic data with genetic variant data derived from rapid genome/exome sequencing.
- Automated variant annotation, filtering, and interpretation incorporating variant pathogenicity classifications such as VUS, Pathogenic, and Likely Pathogenic.
- Use of databases of known gene–disease relationships (e.g., OMIM, ClinVar) and allele frequency data for variant filtering.
- The methodology includes rapid sequencing workflows and associated software platforms (MOON™, InterVar™) for automated analysis and provisional genetic diagnosis.
- Ranking of variants and diseases based on phenotype-genotype matching and pathogenicity scoring.
- Consideration of inheritance modes (autosomal dominant/recessive, X-linked), trio or family-based sequencing to aid interpretation.
- Probabilistic scoring and Bayesian framework usage in MOON™ is mentioned, aiming to increase sensitivity and rank provisional diagnoses.
- Reporting of provisional diagnoses with associated confidence for clinical decision support.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses predominantly on rapid automated phenotype extraction from EHRs and integration with variant pathogenicity and disease-phenotype databases to rank differential diagnoses.
- It emphasizes rapid sequencing and autonomous provisional diagnosis but does not disclose integration of genome-wide prior probabilities of observing disease-causing variants under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
- Does not explicitly quantify or integrate false negative probabilities (e.g., from unobserved or missing variants) to compute Bayesian posterior probabilities reflecting diagnostic confidence or credible intervals.
- The probabilistic or Bayesian methods mentioned are applied chiefly to variant pathogenicity and disease matching, rather than modeling the confidence in a **complete genetic diagnosis** at the genome- or gene-level considering TP, FP, FN, TN outcomes.
- No detailed description or claim of genome-wide prior probability modeling of variant occurrence or explicit Bayesian calculation of diagnostic certainty integrating prior and observed/missing variant data.
- The system's Bayesian models appear focused on variant ranking and disease-phenotype correlation rather than the core Quant innovation of confidence quantification of **observed vs. unobserved** pathogenic variation in a patient.
- Use of commonly available variant databases (ClinVar, gnomAD) and clinical vocabularies is standard and not unique to Quant.
- The patent’s claims do not systemically address modeling or incorporation of false negative probabilities of variant detection into diagnostic posterior probability.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:**  
Although this patent and Quant share general features such as use of natural language processing for phenotype extraction, rapid sequencing, automated variant annotation, and Bayesian ranking to generate provisional genetic disease diagnoses, the core innovation of Quant — the explicit calculation of genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, integration of these priors with patient-specific observed and unobserved variant data, and Bayesian posterior probability computation of diagnostic certainty including credible intervals — is not disclosed or claimed here. The patent’s Bayesian and statistical modeling focus on variant pathogenicity and phenotype correlation rather than the unique quantitative framework for diagnosis confidence embodied by Quant. Hence, the technical methods do not represent a close theoretical overlap sufficient to be blocking.
