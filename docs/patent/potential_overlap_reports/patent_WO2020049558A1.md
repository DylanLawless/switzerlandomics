#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A method of fetal genotyping, comprises receiving maternal genomic DNA (gDNA) data, maternal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) data, and paternal gDNA data of a pair parenting to a fetus. The data are analyzed to identify a first set of sites at which the parents are homozygous for different alleles, and a second set at which at least one of the parents has a mutation. For each site of the first set, a probability that a respective portion of the maternal cfDNA data is derived from the fetus is determined. Each site of the second set is classified according to the determined probabilities as being either fetal or maternal to genotype the fetus."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent describes a method of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) via analysis of maternal cfDNA combined with parental genomic data for fetal genotyping.
- The method involves:
  - Identification of sites segregating between parents (homozygous for different alleles) and mutation sites in parents.
  - Determining, for each site, the probability that aligned cfDNA fragments are fetal or maternal in origin.
  - Using Bayesian procedures to integrate prior probabilities derived from parental genotypes with cfDNA data, including fragment length distributions as a key metric to help distinguish fetal versus maternal DNA.
  - Application of machine learning or deep learning for recalibration of probabilities or direct end-to-end classification of fetal genotype.
- The method explicitly models all possible fetal genotypes at each locus (e.g., 0/0, 0/1, 1/1), calculates likelihoods per read, integrates fragment size data, and uses parental genotype information to inform priors.
- False negative probabilities are implicitly accounted for by considering the likelihoods of observing fetal alleles given technical and biological variability.
- The use of posterior probabilities and credible intervals to quantify confidence in fetal genotyping echoes Quant’s unique feature of reporting diagnostic certainty intervals.
- Technical specifics overlap substantially:
  - Input data types: maternal cfDNA, maternal and paternal gDNA.
  - Use of allele-specific fragment length distributions to improve inference.
  - Bayesian integration of prior genotype probabilities with observed data.
  - Machine learning recalibration of posterior probabilities.
- The patent claims both Bayesian methods and end-to-end deep learning models for fetal genotyping that use probability outputs rather than simple classification scores.
- Genotyping is applied genome-wide, across single nucleotide variants and indels, closely resembling Quant's genome-wide variant probability framework.
- The methods explicitly distinguish true positives and false negatives in variant detection, aligning with Quant's key theoretical approach to modeling TP, FN, FP, and TN.

#### Key Differences

- Quant focuses on genome-wide **disease-causing variant probabilities** under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and integrates prior probabilities of observing pathogenic variants, modes of inheritance, and population allele frequency data.
- The patent chiefly addresses **fetal genotyping** from maternal plasma DNA in non-invasive prenatal diagnosis, focusing on fetal variant detection in the context of parental variants.
- Although the patent uses Bayesian methods and machine learning, it does so specifically for distinguishing fetal and maternal origin of cfDNA fragments and genotyping the fetus, rather than explicitly calculating genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants or providing credible intervals for a complete genetic diagnosis.
- Quant integrates missing/unobserved data (false negatives, unsequenced regions) for confident diagnosis, whereas the patent focuses on assigning probabilities of fetal origin to observed fragments for fetal genotype calls.
- The patent’s use of fragment length and SAM flags to discriminate fetal vs. maternal cfDNA reads, while innovative, is a different problem scope than Quant’s disease-focused genome-wide prior calculation.
- The end goal of the patent is genotyping fetal variants noninvasively, while Quant’s scope includes quantifying the **probability of a complete genetic diagnosis** integrating variant observations genome-wide, which is broader.
- Quant’s emphasis on genetic diagnosis certainty, inheritance modeling across all genes and diseases, and credible intervals is not explicitly disclosed in the patent.
- The patent is clinically focused on the prenatal setting and symptoms of congenital or monogenic diseases, whereas Quant is broader in research and clinical genetics usage.

#### Conclusion

Potential overlap — recommend legal review.

---

**Explanation:**  
This patent shares a highly similar Bayesian framework that integrates parental genotype priors with observed cfDNA fragment-level data and machine learning recalibration to compute posterior probabilities for fetal genotype calls. Specific concepts such as modeling true positives, false negatives, applying empirical fetal fraction based on fragment lengths, and generating calibrated posterior probabilities closely resemble Quant’s core theoretical approach. However, the patent is specialized to non-invasive fetal genotyping rather than the genome-wide genetic diagnosis confidence modeling of Quant. Nevertheless, the technical overlap is substantial enough that Quant’s freedom to operate may be affected. Further detailed claim analysis and legal scrutiny is warranted to delineate the precise scope and possible design-arounds.
