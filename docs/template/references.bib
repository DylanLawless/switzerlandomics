            Large-scale association analyses using whole-genome sequence data have become feasible, but understanding the functional impacts of these associations remains challenging. Although many tools are available to predict the functional impacts of genetic variants, it is unclear which tool should be used in practice. This work provides a practical guide to assist in selecting appropriate tools for variant annotation. We conducted a MEDLINE search up to November 10, 2023, and included tools that are applicable to a broad range of phenotypes, can be used locally, and have been recently updated. Tools were categorized based on the types of variants they accept and the functional impacts they predict. Sequence Ontology terms were used for standardization. We identified 118 databases and software packages, encompassing 36 variant types and 161 functional impacts. Combining only three tools, namely SnpEff, FAVOR, and SparkINFERNO, allows predicting 99 (61\%) distinct functional impacts. Thirty-seven tools predict 89 functional impacts that are not supported by any other tool, while 75 tools predict pathogenicity and can be used within the ACMG/AMP guidelines in a clinical context. We launched a website allowing researchers to select tools based on desired variants and impacts. In summary, more than 100 tools are already available to predict approximately 160 functional impacts. About 60\% of the functional impacts can be predicted by the combination of three tools. Unexpectedly, recent tools do not predict more impacts than older ones. Future research should allow predicting the functionality of so far unsupported variant types, such as gene fusions.

            Rapid advances in high‐throughput DNA sequencing technologies have enabled large‐scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies. Before performing association analysis between phenotypes and genotypes, preprocessing and quality control (QC) of the raw sequence data need to be performed. Because many biostatisticians have not been working with WGS data so far, we first sketch Illumina's short‐read sequencing technology. Second, we explain the general preprocessing pipeline for WGS studies. Third, we provide an overview of important QC metrics, which are applied to WGS data: on the raw data, after mapping and alignment, after variant calling, and after multisample variant calling. Fourth, we illustrate the QC with the data from the GENEtic SequencIng Study Hamburg–Davos (GENESIS‐HD), a study involving more than 9000 human whole genomes. All samples were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with an average coverage of 35× using a PCR‐free protocol. For QC, one genome in a bottle (GIAB) trio was sequenced in four replicates, and one GIAB sample was successfully sequenced 70 times in different runs. Fifth, we provide empirical data on the compression of raw data using the DRAGEN original read archive (ORA). The most important quality metrics in the application were genetic similarity, sample cross‐contamination, deviations from the expected Het/Hom ratio, relatedness, and coverage. The compression ratio of the raw files using DRAGEN ORA was 5.6:1, and compression time was linear by genome coverage. In summary, the preprocessing, joint calling, and QC of large WGS studies are feasible within a reasonable time, and efficient QC procedures are readily available.},

            The Hamburg City Health Study (HCHS) is a large, prospective, long-term, population-based cohort study and a unique research platform and network to obtain substantial knowledge about several important risk and prognostic factors in major chronic diseases. A random sample of 45,000 participants between 45 and 74 years of age from the general population of Hamburg, Germany, are taking part in an extensive baseline assessment at one dedicated study center. Participants undergo 13 validated and 5 novel examinations primarily targeting major organ system function and structures including extensive imaging examinations. The protocol includes validate self-reports via questionnaires regarding lifestyle and environmental conditions, dietary habits, physical condition and activity, sexual dysfunction, professional life, psychosocial context and burden, quality of life, digital media use, occupational, medical and family history as well as healthcare utilization. The assessment is completed by genomic and proteomic characterization. Beyond the identification of classical risk factors for major chronic diseases and survivorship, the core intention is to gather valid prevalence and incidence, and to develop complex models predicting health outcomes based on a multitude of examination data, imaging, biomarker, psychosocial and behavioral assessments. Participants at risk for coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, stroke and dementia are invited for a visit to conduct an additional MRI examination of either heart or brain. Endpoint assessment of the overall sample will be completed through repeated follow-up examinations and surveys as well as related individual routine data from involved health and pension insurances. The study is targeting the complex relationship between biologic and psychosocial risk and resilience factors, chronic disease, health care use, survivorship and health as well as favorable and bad prognosis within a unique, large-scale long-term assessment with the perspective of further examinations after 6 years in a representative European metropolitan population.},

              Aims
              Cardiomyopathies (CMPs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases that are defined by structural and functional abnormalities of the cardiac muscle. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the most common CMP, is defined by left ventricular dilation and impaired contractility and represents a common cause of heart failure. Different phenotypes result from various underlying genetic and acquired causes with variable effects on disease development and progression, prognosis, and response to medical treatment. Current treatment algorithms do not consider these different aetiologies, due to lack of insights into treatable drivers of cardiac failure in patients with DCM. Our study aims to precisely phenotype and genotype the various subtypes of DCM and hereby lay the foundation for individualized therapy.
            
            
              Methods and results
              The Geno‐ And Phenotyping of PrImary Cardiomyopathy (GrAPHIC) is a currently ongoing prospective observational monocentric cohort study that recruits patients with DCM after exclusion of other causes such as coronary artery disease, valvular dysfunction, myocarditis, exposure to toxins, and peripartum CMP. Patients are enrolled at our heart failure outpatient clinic or during hospitalization at the University Hospital Hamburg. Clinical parameters, multimodal imaging and functional assessment, cardiac biopsies, and blood samples are obtained to enable an integrated genomic, functional, and biomarker analysis.
          
              Conclusions
              The GrAPHIC will contribute to a better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of primary CMPs focusing on DCM and provide improved prognostic approaches and more individualized therapies.},

First, we computed genome-wide occurrence probabilities by integrating population allele frequencies, variant classifications, and Hardy-Weinberg expectations under autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked inheritance. Second, both pathogenic variants and missing causal candidates were tested to identify the most likely genetic disease determinant and provide a clear confidence range for the overall diagnosis. This provided a complete and interpretable summary of evidence for genetic diagnosis. Third, we summarised variant probabilities for 557 genes responsible for inborn errors of immunity (IEI), now integrated into a public database. Fourth, we derived new data-driven IEI classifications using protein-protein interactions and curated clinical features, aligned to immunophenotypes. Finally, we validated the framework in national-scale cohorts, showing close concordance with observed case numbers.

	abstract = {Variant set association tests (VSAT), especially those incorporating rare variants via variant collapse, are invaluable in genetic studies. However, unlike Manhattan plots for single-variant tests, VSAT statistics lack intrinsic genomic coordinates, hindering visual interpretation. To overcome this, we developed the Archipelago method, which assigns a meaningful genomic coordinate to VSAT P values so that both set-level and individual variant associations can be visualised together. This results in an intuitive and information rich illustration akin to an archipelago of clustered islands, enhancing the understanding of both collective and individual impacts of variants. In a validation study using 504 East Asian subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (250 cases, 254 controls), we first conducted a single-variant GWAS using logistic regression with Firth correction. We then performed an equivalent case/control analysis by collapsing variants into protein pathways (defined via STRINGdb and PreoMCLustR) and testing associations with SKAT-O. The Archipelago plot is applicable in any genetic association study that uses variant collapse to evaluate both individual variants and variant sets, and its customizability facilitates clear communication of complex genetic data. By integrating at least two dimensions of genetic data into a single visualization, VSAT results can be easily read and aid in identification of potential causal variants in variant sets such as protein pathways.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study uses previously public dataset of 504 East Asian individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (version 5, hg19) available at http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Introduction Children represent a large and vulnerable patient group. However, the evidence-base for most paediatric diagnostic and therapeutic procedures remains limited or is often inferred from adults. There is urgency to improve paediatric health care provision based on real-world evidence generation. The digital transformation is a unique opportunity to shape a data-driven, agile, learning health care system and deliver more efficient and personalized care to children and their families. The goal of SwissPedHealth is to build a sustainable and scalable infrastructure to make routine clinical data from paediatric hospitals in Switzerland interoperable, standardized, quality-controlled, and ready for observational research, quality assurance, trials, and health-policy creation. This paper describes the design, aims, and current achievements of SwissPedHealth.Methods and analysis SwissPedHealth started in September 2022 as one of four National Data Streams co-funded by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) and the Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT). SwissPedHealth develops modular governance and regulatory strategies, and harnesses SPHN automatization procedures, in collaboration with clinical data warehouses, the Data Coordination Center, Biomedical Information Technology Network, and other SPHN institutions and funded projects. The SwissPedHealth consortium is led by a multi-site, multi-disciplinary Steering Committee incorporating patient and family representatives. The data stream contains work packages focusing on: 1) governance and implementation of standardized data collection, 2) nested projects to test the feasibility of the data stream, 3) a lighthouse project that enriches the data stream by integrating multi-omics data, aiming to improve diagnoses of rare diseases, and 4) engagement with families through patient and public involvement activities and bioethics interviews.Ethics and dissemination The health database regulation of SwissPedHealth was approved by the ethics committee (AO_2022-00018). Research findings will be disseminated through national and international conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and in lay language via online media and podcasts.ARTICLE SUMMARY⍰ The paediatric national data stream SwissPedHealth focuses on routine clinical data from children at Swiss University Children{\textquoteright}s Hospitals, spans disciplines and is built in a scalable and modular way in terms of governance, data infrastructure, and patient and public involvement, to enable a gradual increase in coverage of the Swiss child population.⍰ SwissPedHealth strives to increase readiness for quality improvement, research, and personalized paediatric health care.⍰ SwissPedHealth{\textquoteright}s infrastructure aligns with the national frameworks, safeguarding data security and adhering to a standard interoperability framework based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF).⍰ SwissPedHealth seeks to explore integration of data from external sources such as federal statistics, cohorts, and registries, which have their own governance and data formats.{\textbullet} SwissPedHealth investigates the use of multi-omics workflows to improve diagnosis of rare diseases in children with life-threatening phenotypesCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was supported through the grant NDS-2021-911 (SwissPedHealth) from the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) and the Strategic Focal Area Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT) of the ETH Domain (Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ethics committee Northwest and Central Switzerland (EKNZ, AO_2022-00018) gave ethical approval for the health database regulation of SwissPedHealth.

	abstract = {We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that uses established genomic metrics {\textendash} such as the GuRu score, variant/gene risk priors, and population frequency {\textendash} to estimate the probability of observing a given genetic variant in disease. Importantly, our approach does not directly predict variant pathogenicity; instead, it quantifies the cumulative evidence supporting a variant{\textquoteright}s clinical observability within a Bayesian context. Using simulated genetic data with a range of variability and label noise, we systematically evaluated the actor-critic algorithm performance across multiple scenarios, employing metrics including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots, and learning dynamics. Results indicate predictive accuracy and effective learning, demonstrating RL{\textquoteright}s potential as a practical tool for genomic variant interpretation, setting the stage for integration into a broader Bayesian classification framework.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesI confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

              Motivation
              Variant call format (VCF) files are the standard output format for various software tools that identify genetic variation from DNA sequencing experiments. Downstream analyses require the ability to query, filter, and modify them simply and efficiently. Several tools are available to perform these operations from the command line, including BCFTools, vembrane, slivar, and others.
            
            
              Results
              Here, we introduce vcfexpress, a new, high-performance toolset for the analysis of VCF files, written in the Rust programming language. It is nearly as fast as BCFTools, but adds functionality to execute user expressions in the lua programming language for precise filtering and reporting of variants from a VCF or BCF file. We demonstrate performance and flexibility by comparing vcfexpress to other tools using the vembrane benchmark.
            
            
              Availability and implementation
