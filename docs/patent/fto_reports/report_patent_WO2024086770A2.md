#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "This disclosure provides compositions and methods for characterizing and treating neuroinflammation, dementia, and cognitive impairment... methods described herein use the detection of somatic mutations in a biological sample derived from a subject to detect the presence or absence of Alzheimer's disease or other neurodegenerative disorders in the subject."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent emphasize probabilistic and quantitative approaches to genetic variation in relation to disease diagnosis.
- Both systems rely on high-depth sequencing methods incorporating unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) to identify low-frequency somatic mutations.
- The patent discloses detecting somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) and indels across proliferation-related genes; panel sequencing targets tumor suppressor and proliferation genes with deep coverage (>1000X), generating consensus reads from UMIs—similar technical preprocessing steps as Quant’s data input and processing.
- It involves estimating somatic mutation burden and associating it with neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease.
- Cell-type specific analyses using flow-sorted nuclei and single-nucleus RNA-seq are described to identify mutation-bearing microglia, which partially resembles Quant’s focus on integrating observed variant data and false negative probabilities for diagnostic confidence.
- Bayesian modeling elements are present in their RNA-MosaicHunter tool to discern mutations from sequencing noise.
  
#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on *detecting* somatic mutations and attributing increased burden to neuroinflammatory states or Alzheimer’s disease, emphasizing clonal expansions and mutation burden as biomarkers.
- Quant uniquely centers on integrating prior probabilities derived from population allele frequencies and variant classifications across the entire genome under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium with observed *patient-specific* true positives and false negatives — to calculate a *Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis* with credible intervals.
- Quant’s key innovation is quantifying diagnostic confidence genome-wide, modeling all TP, FP, TN, FN outcomes, rather than primarily identifying or associating somatic mutation burden with disease presence.
- The patent does not discuss nor claim methods to integrate prior variant probabilities and expected false negatives into a unified Bayesian posterior probability of diagnosis.
- The patent is targeted specifically at neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders focusing on somatic mutation burden in microglial and blood lineage cells, while Quant has a broader intended use for rare disease diagnosis genome-wide, across all inheritance modes.
- The patent exemplifies cohort-level comparisons and mutation burden increases rather than providing individualized diagnostic probabilities.
  
#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** While the patent discloses comprehensive methods to detect and quantify somatic mutations associated with neuroinflammation and Alzheimer’s disease, using deep sequencing with UMIs and analyses that include Bayesian steps to detect mutations reliably, it does not overlap with Quant’s core innovation. Quant distinctly provides a genome-wide Bayesian framework integrating prior probabilities of variant pathogenicity, observed variants, and false negatives to compute a posterior probability of an individual's *complete* genetic diagnosis with credible intervals. The patent focuses on somatic mutation burden as a biomarker rather than the diagnostic certainty modeling central to Quant.
