#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Disclosed are synthetic oligonucleotides for the diagnosis (genotyping) of the c-23+1G>A (rs80338940) mutation of the GJB2 gene in human biomaterial. The primers are combined into kits for detecting DNA in blood and other biological materials by polymerase chain reaction. The invention enables highly sensitive diagnostics of congenital hereditary deafness... The method provides highly sensitive and objective genotype determination for homozygous and heterozygous carriers of this mutation."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent focuses on detecting a specific genetic mutation (c.-23+1G>A in GJB2) using allele-specific real-time PCR with fluorescent probes.
- Uses a molecular biology technique (PCR with allele-specific primers and probes) to detect mutant versus wild-type alleles.
- The method determines genotype status (homozygous, heterozygous) based on DNA melting curve analysis.
- This is a genetic diagnostic method involving variant detection in clinical samples.

#### Key Differences

- Quant’s innovation is a computational Bayesian framework integrating prior probabilities of pathogenic variant presence with observed/missing variant data to calculate diagnostic posterior probabilities and credible intervals across genome-wide variants and inheritance modes.
- RU2746055C1 is focused narrowly on molecular detection of a single known pathogenic variant using PCR chemistry and probe design.
- No mention or implication of Bayesian integration, probabilistic diagnosis of the entire genome, or treatment of false negatives, true positives, or comprehensive variant probabilities.
- The patent does not address genome-wide variant probability calculation, prior probability modeling, or diagnosis confidence intervals.
- Quant’s method is computational and statistical, whereas this patent pertains to wet-lab assay design and PCR-based genotyping.
- No overlap with the TP/FN modeling or Bayesian diagnostic confidence estimation central to Quant.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.  
This patent is a molecular diagnostic assay specifically for detecting one mutation by PCR; it does not overlap with Quant’s genome-wide Bayesian probabilistic diagnosis framework integrating prior variant probabilities and patient variant data.
