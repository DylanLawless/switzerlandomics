#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Compositions and methods useful for treating and/or preventing hearing loss caused by a genetic mutation in the TMPRSS3 gene or the LOXHD1 gene are disclosed. The compositions and methods disclosed herein use adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector genes to deliver TRMPSS3 or LOXHD1 to the inner ear to restore the activity of the TMPRSS3 gene or LOXHD1 gene, respectively, to promote hair cell survival and restore hearing in patients with hearing loss."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent relates to genetic diagnosis and treatment of hereditary hearing loss caused by specific gene mutations (TMPRSS3, LOXHD1).
- It involves nucleic acid sequences (e.g., SEQ ID NOs) and expression vectors (notably AAV) for gene replacement therapy.
- Use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing as therapeutic modalities are described.
- Discussion of genotype-phenotype correlations and hearing loss progression models.
- Use of genetic testing to identify mutations pre-symptomatically is disclosed.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses strictly on therapeutic gene delivery techniques, vector design, and in vivo/in vitro gene therapy approaches for hearing loss.
- It does not disclose or claim any computational or statistical methods for variant probability estimation or integration of prior probabilities with observed/missing data.
- There is no indication of methods quantifying diagnostic confidence, false negatives, or Bayesian posterior probabilities for a genetic diagnosis.
- No mention or use of TP/FN/FP/TN classification metrics or genome-wide probability scoring for pathogenic variants.
- The technology centers on gene replacement or editing for functional gene restoration rather than variant interpretation probabilities.
- The patent's claims relate to compositions, vectors, therapeutic methods, and transgenic animal models, not computational variant probability models or diagnostic certainty scores.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** This patent describes gene therapy compositions and methods to restore hearing by delivering functional TMPRSS3 or LOXHD1 genes, primarily through viral vectors, and includes relevant animal models and cell lines. While it references genetic mutations and genetic diagnosis as context, it does not disclose or claim computational modeling or statistical integration of variant data to assess pathogenicity probabilities or confident genetic diagnoses as implemented by Quant. Therefore, there is no technical overlap on Quantâ€™s core innovation of Bayesian modeling of variant observation probabilities integrating TP/FN classification.
