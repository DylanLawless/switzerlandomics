#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The invention provides a molecular classifier and a targeted sequencing assay for use in characterization and treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent describes a molecular classifier that uses a targeted sequencing panel to characterize classes of genetic variants (mutations, structural variants (SVs), somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs)) across a comprehensive set of genes and regions associated with DLBCL.
- It employs classification-specific weighted values for variant classes and condenses them into metafeatures, which are then used as input variables for computational analysis to assign DLBCL subclasses, designated as C1 to C5.
- The classifier is implemented via machine learning methods, particularly artificial neural networks.
- The framework includes generating probabilistic assignments with confidence measures.
- The patent baits (oligonucleotide probes) cover comprehensive variant classes inclusive of mutations, SVs, and SCNAs necessary for classification.
- The method explicitly links classification outcomes to selection of specific treatments, including targeted agents (NOTCH inhibitors, BCL6 inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, JAK/STAT inhibitors, BRAF/MEK inhibitors) aligned with DLBCL subclasses.
- The patent provides detailed algorithms for weighting variant alterations and integrating multi-class variant data into metafeatures for classification.
- The molecular classifier emphasizes probabilistic classification and confidence scoring, supporting clinical decision-making.
- A web-based or software platform is described for data input (gene-sample matrix), classification computation, visualization (e.g., heatmaps, UMAP), and report generation.
  
#### Key Differences

- No explicit use or discussion of integration of prior probabilities of pathogenic variant observation genome-wide, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium computations, or Bayesian modeling to explicitly quantify false negative (FN) probabilities and derive posterior probabilities of complete genetic diagnosis, which are hallmarks of Quant.
- The patent focuses on classification of DLBCL tumor subtypes based on observed variant data; it does not address genome-wide estimation of disease-causing variant probabilities nor does it integrate unobserved or missing variant data into diagnosis confidence metrics.
- The approach is centered on supervised machine learning classifiers for subtype assignment, not on probabilistic modeling encompassing true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) outcomes with explicit probabilistic diagnosis certainty intervals.
- Absent is a theory or method that aggregates variant-level prior pathogenicity or observation rates across the genome to compute a Bayesian posterior probability of disease status.
- No explicit incorporation of population frequency data, variant interpretation uncertainty, or credible intervals for variant observation probabilities akin to Quant.
- The method uses weighted sums of variant classes for metafeatures, but does not describe a probabilistic framework based on Bayesian integration with coverage or missing data models.
- While the patent integrates multiple variant types (mutation, SCNA, SV), it does not provide a diagnostic confidence quantification or model the probability of a complete genetic diagnosis in a Bayesian framework.
  
#### Conclusion

"Not blocking for Quant."

**Reasoning:**  
This patent provides a sophisticated machine learning-based molecular classifier for subtyping DLBCL tumors based on observed variant classifications weighted into metafeatures, coupled with a targeted sequencing assay. However, it does not disclose or suggest the novel Bayesian probabilistic framework integral to Quant, where genome-wide prior probabilities (e.g., under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), integration of observed and potentially missing variant data (accounting for false negatives), and calculation of posterior probabilities with credible intervals for complete genetic diagnosis are computed. The technical core and theory of using true positive (TP), false negative (FN), etc. within a Bayesian diagnosis certainty model is not present. The patent focuses on subtyping and treatment selection rather than probabilistic assessment of genome-wide variant pathogenicity and diagnosis confidence. Therefore, it does not legally block Quantâ€™s unique innovations.
