#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "To provide a gene exasperating the production of amyloid-β protein, to provide the protein, and to provide their uses... The gene exasperating the production of the amyloid-β protein. The protein or its salt encoded in the gene. An antibody against the protein. A diagnostic agent or medicine containing the antibody. A method for screening a compound effective for treating Alzheimer's disease with the protein or the like.."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent describes novel genes and proteins that enhance Aβ production involved in Alzheimer's disease.
- It discloses isolation, expression, and use of these proteins and related antibodies as diagnostics and therapeutics.
- The genes/proteins are characterized by specific amino acid sequences (SEQ ID NOs: 1, 3, 5, 7, 19) and corresponding DNAs.
- Describes methods of screening compounds inhibiting these proteins’ function to suppress Aβ production.
- Provides extensive molecular biology methods: cloning, cDNA libraries, expression in cells, antibody generation and use, recombinant vectors, transformants, animal models.
- The technology focuses on identification and manipulation of specific genetic factors controlling Aβ production, establishing functional assays for drug screening, and diagnostic reagents.
- Uses substantially direct biochemical, genetic, and immunological methods to influence or detect Aβ production at the gene/protein level.

#### Key Differences

- The patent primarily concerns identification and use of specific individual genes/proteins that modulate Aβ production (Alzheimer’s disease pathology).
- Patent focuses on isolated proteins, antibodies, nucleotides, screening by presence or absence of Aβ or associated functional assays.
- No disclosure of calculating genome-wide prior probabilities for disease-causing genetic variants.
- No mention or claim of integrating known population variant frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium probabilities, or observation models (TP, FN, FP, TN).
- Does not address Bayesian posterior probability of a *complete genetic diagnosis* or quantify uncertainty/credible intervals of diagnostic confidence.
- Does not propose any genome-wide, inheritance-mode specific probabilistic framework combining unobserved and observed variant data.
- No teaching of statistical integration of variant pathogenicity priors and patient genotype data to produce a probabilistic diagnosis metric as in Quant.
- Patent restricted to variant-level experimental or screening approaches for identifying modulators of Aβ, not methods to compute patient-specific diagnosis probabilities from population genetics data.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
This patent and publication present isolated genes and proteins related to Aβ production and their antibody and drug screening applications specific to Alzheimer’s disease. It is focused on molecular biology and functional experimentation with specific genes. It does not teach or suggest any genome-wide Bayesian probabilistic modeling of variant observations or calculation of posterior probabilities incorporating TP, FN, and allele frequencies to quantify clinical diagnostic confidence as presented in Quant. The core Bayesian genotype-to-diagnosis probabilistic framework is absent, making this patent non-overlapping and non-blocking for Quant.
