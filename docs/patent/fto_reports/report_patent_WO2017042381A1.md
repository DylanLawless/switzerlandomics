#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention belongs to the field of autoinflammatory diseases, particularly to the diagnosis of autoinflammatory diseases, more particularly to the specific diagnosis and/or prognosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF). Accordingly the present invention provides methods and kits for the diagnostic use of FMF."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of biological samples (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) from patients for diagnostic purposes.
- Quantification of specific cytokines levels (inflammasome-dependent such as IL-1 beta, IL-18; and inflammasome-independent like IL-6, TNF-alpha) to distinguish disease states.
- Use of stimulation assays with microbial agents (e.g., Clostridium difficile toxins TcdA and TcdB) to provoke differential cytokine responses.
- Differentiation of disease states based on observed true positive biological markers (e.g., elevated IL-1 beta or IL-18).
- Use of treatment or inhibition (e.g., colchicine pretreatment) to reveal differential immune responses.
- Functional assays are used to identify patients (FMF) versus heterozygous carriers or healthy controls.
- Quantification of response metrics (2-fold enhancement, 4-fold reduction levels, or higher fold changes) to make diagnostic decisions.
- Monitoring changes in markers to assess therapy response over time.
- The concept of distinguishing observed signals (cytokine secretion profiles) from control samples (healthy or other disease states).

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on a biological immunological assay—measuring cytokine secretion and inflammasome activation in immune cells stimulated ex vivo by microbial toxins.
- It does not address genetic variant interpretation or genome-wide probabilistic modeling.
- There is no use or integration of population allele frequencies, variant-level pathogenicity priors, or inheritance modeling.
- No Bayesian integration of prior variant probabilities with observed or missing variant data (TP, FN, etc.).
- Does not compute a posterior probability quantifying diagnostic certainty based on genetic variant data.
- Focused on functional cellular immune response rather than computational genetic diagnosis.
- No mention or use of probabilistic modeling of false negatives or unsequenced regions.
- Diagnostic evaluation is based on fold changes in cytokine levels rather than statistical credible intervals or genome-wide assessments.
- Different biological domain: autoinflammatory cytokine assays versus genome variant probability framework.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.  
This patent discloses immunological diagnostic methods based on cytokine profiling after ex vivo stimulation and does not overlap with Quant’s genome-wide Bayesian probabilistic modeling approach for variant-level disease diagnosis integrating TP, FN, and prior probabilities.
