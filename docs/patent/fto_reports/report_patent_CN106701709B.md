#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The invention discloses ATM gene mutants and applications thereof, including isolated nucleic acids encoding ATM gene mutants with specific mutations (e.g., c.4777-2A>T, c.3078G>T, c.7983_7985delTGT, c.477_481delATCTC). By detecting the presence of these mutants in a biological sample, susceptibility to ataxia telangiectasia can be effectively detected."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent addresses genetic mutations in the ATM gene associated with ataxia telangiectasia, a rare autosomal recessive disorder.
- It focuses on isolated nucleic acids encoding specific mutations, corresponding polypeptides, and diagnostic methods to detect these mutations by sequencing.
- There is mention of PCR primer design, sequencing approaches, and mutation detection assays.
- The technology involves identifying and validating mutation presence in patient samples for disease diagnosis.

#### Key Differences

- The patent relates primarily to identifying specific novel mutations in the ATM gene and developing methods and kits for detecting these mutations.
- No mention or indication of:

  - Calculating prior probabilities of pathogenic variants genome-wide.
  - Integration of population allele frequencies or Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium considerations.
  - Bayesian posterior probability calculations that incorporate observed true positives (TP) and potential false negatives (FN) to estimate diagnostic confidence.
  - Modeling diagnostic uncertainty or providing credible intervals for genetic diagnosis.

- The method is a typical mutation detection approach (PCR amplification, sequencing, mutation presence/absence), without the statistical modeling or probabilistic framework key to Quant.
- Focused on a single gene and known mutation sites, not a genome-wide variant probability platform.
- Does not integrate missing data or false negative assessments beyond presence/absence calls.
- No use of TP, FP, TN, FN metrics or Bayesian integration of prior probabilities to generate posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** This patent is a classic genetic diagnostic patent focusing narrowly on specific ATM gene mutations and detection methods. While it covers identifying and detecting pathogenic variants, it does not employ or claim the core innovative probabilistic framework and Bayesian integration of prior probabilities, observed variant data, false negatives, and inheritance mode modeling central to Quantâ€™s functionality. Therefore, there is no substantive technical overlap that would block or limit freedom-to-operate for Quant.
