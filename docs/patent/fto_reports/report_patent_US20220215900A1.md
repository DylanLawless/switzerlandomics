#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Methods, systems, and software are provided for determining copy number variation status of a subject. A first plurality of nucleic acid sequences generated by whole genome sequencing at an average depth of 0.5× to 5× is obtained from a first sample. A second plurality of nucleic acid sequences generated by panel-targeted sequencing is obtained from a second sample. A first mapped dataset is obtained by mapping the first plurality of sequences to positions within a reference genome. A second mapped dataset is obtained by mapping the second plurality of sequences to positions within a reference construct for genomic regions targeted by the panel-targeted sequencing. A model is applied to all or a portion of the first mapped dataset and all or a portion of the second mapped dataset, or dimensionality reduction components thereof, thereby identifying one or more copy number variations, as output of the model, that indicate the copy number variation status of the subject."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of low-pass whole genome sequencing (lc-WGS) at ~0.5× to 5× coverage combined with panel-targeted sequencing (e.g., whole exome sequencing) at higher coverage (~40×), to jointly detect copy number variants (CNVs).
- Mapping of sequence reads from both lc-WGS and panel sequencing to a reference genome or targeted regions.
- Binning of aligned reads into genomic segments and deriving bin-level depth or copy number states.
- Application of computational models, including machine learning models or statistical inference, on combined datasets (or dimensionality-reduced components thereof) from both WGS and panel data for CNV calling.
- Use of a gating or consensus framework where two component models evaluate the respective datasets and CNV calls are accepted only if supported by both.
- A focus on improving sensitivity and specificity for small CNVs, including single-exon or few-exon deletions/duplications, overcoming the noise in panel data alone or lc-WGS alone.
- Use of dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component analysis) for feature extraction prior to model application.
- Validation against known truth sets (e.g., 1000 Genomes Chaisson samples analysis).
- Orthogonal validation recommended for putative calls.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses specifically on joint calling of CNVs by combining low-pass WGS and panel sequencing data, not Bayesian variant pathogenicity scoring or integrating true/false positives/negatives to compute posterior confidence in a genetic diagnosis.
- Quant’s novelty lies in using prior disease probabilities, inheritance mode modeling, and explicitly accounting for observed and missing variant data (TP, FN) to produce Bayesian posterior probabilities about carrying a disease-causing variant; this patent does not address such diagnostic confidence modeling.
- This patent’s subject is CNV detection methods using sequencing depth signals and machine learning; it does not describe genome-wide prior variant probabilities or integration of clinical variant annotation databases (e.g., ClinVar) for variant pathogenicity estimation or diagnosis confidence.
- The use case here is focused on CNV calling calibration, improving detection sensitivity and specificity by combining two sequencing inputs; Quant extends beyond variant detection to diagnostic probability quantification.
- While machine learning models are mentioned, the training and use are focused on binary or multi-class CNV state classification, not Bayesian posterior integration of variant pathogenicity priors with observed data including false negatives.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

**Summary:**  
This patent discloses technology for improving CNV calling by jointly leveraging low-pass whole genome sequencing and panel-targeted sequencing data, including sophisticated binning, normalization, and machine learning classification frameworks. It is focused on improving CNV detection at a technical data processing level, addressing sensitivity/specificity trade-offs at low coverage, especially for small events.

Quant, by contrast, innovates in the domain of genome-wide prior probability estimation of disease-causing variants, integration of prior probabilities with observed and missing variant statuses (TP, FN), mode of inheritance considerations, and producing Bayesian posterior probabilities and credible intervals reflecting diagnostic confidence for genetic diseases.

The patent is therefore not blocking Quant’s core innovation or methods, as it does not describe or claim the theoretical framework of using true positive/false negative modeling and integrating prior probabilities into posterior diagnostic risk assessments. Its technical overlap is limited to low-pass WGS and panel sequencing data integration for CNV detection only, which is a distinct domain from Quant’s genome-wide Bayesian variant probability platform.
