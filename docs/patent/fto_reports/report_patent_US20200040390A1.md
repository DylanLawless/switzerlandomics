#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure provides methods of sequencing a region of a nucleic acid and identifying mutations within the region. The disclosed methods may comprise constructing a nucleic acid fragments library of the region of the nucleic acid by using a deoxyribonuclease (DNase) to fragment amplification products of the region generated by long range polymerase chain reaction (LR-PCR) amplification... The disclosed method may detect mutations within the region when the region comprises repetitive sequences."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent relate to the analysis of genetic variants with a focus on difficult-to-sequence repetitive genomic regions.
- The patent discloses a method for targeted amplification (LR-PCR) followed by DNase fragmentation to improve sequencing coverage and mutation detection, especially in repetitive regions (e.g., RPGR-ORF15).
- Duplication analysis using artificial reference sequences to detect frameshift and in-frame duplications is described, with emphasis on detection and zygosity assessment.
- The patent addresses false negatives arising from prior fragmentation methods (transposase-based Nextera) by introducing an enzymatic fragmentation (OneTube method) yielding improved coverage.
- Both incorporate depth of coverage metrics, mutation detection accuracy, and bioinformatic strategies for variant detection in complex regions.
- The patent emphasizes mutation identification and accurate variant detection at a technical sequencing and library preparation level.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on molecular biology methods: sequencing library construction, fragmentation protocols, and improved variant detection in repetitive sequences through wet lab and bioinformatics refinements.
- Quant’s unique innovation lies in genome-wide variant probability calculation integrating prior probabilities, Bayesian inference including TP, FP, TN, and FN modeling, generating posterior probabilities and credible intervals for genetic diagnosis confidence.
- The patent does not describe nor claim any probabilistic modeling, Bayesian integration of prior and observed data, or calculation of posterior probabilities of diagnosis.
- No mention or claim of quantifying false negatives within a Bayesian framework to assess diagnostic certainty as in Quant.
- The patent’s claims and description address improving sequencing sensitivity and mutation detection accuracy, not downstream genome-wide diagnostic probability modeling.
- Use of public datasets or clinical variant pathogenicity scoring is absent; rather, focus is on methods for high-throughput sequencing in difficult regions.
- Duplication analysis is computational but relies on artificial reference alignment, not Bayesian genotype probability modeling.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** This patent is primarily concerned with sequencing technology enhancements and library preparation for difficult genomic regions, with mutation detection improvements specifically for repetitive sequences like RPGR-ORF15. It does not address or overlap with Quant’s unique Bayesian statistical framework that integrates prior probabilities with observed/missing variant data to quantify diagnostic confidence. The technical focus and claims are distinct and complementary but do not present blocking overlap with Quant’s core innovation.
