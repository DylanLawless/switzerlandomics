#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Disclosed herein are system, method, and computer program product embodiments for determining phenotypic impacts of molecular variants identified within a biological sample... determining functional scores for the molecular variants based on statistical learning... determining phenotypic impacts of molecular variants based on the functional scores or evidence scores."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Employs machine learning/statistical learning to associate molecular, phenotype, and population signals with phenotypic impacts of variants.
- Uses single-cell and model system cellular compartments to gather multi-dimensional molecular data.
- Derives functional scores for molecular variants via data-driven models.
- Uses dimensionality reduction (e.g., autoencoders, PCA) on molecular data for downstream classification.
- Incorporates multi-state modeling such as cell-cycle phases, analogous to integrating molecular states.
- Applies multi-gene/pathway scale modeling for variant impact.
- Uses complex phenotype models trained on molecular measurements to classify pathogenicity.
- Employs supervised and unsupervised learning on large-scale functional assay data.
- Derives predictive models (Variant Interpretation Engines) incorporating functional scores and annotations.
- Describes scoring of evidence and classifier calibration.
- Accounts for uncertainty and noise in molecular measurements.
- Uses multi-level variant impact predictions: functional, predictor (VIE), and hotspot scores.
- Considers molecular, phenotype, and population signals, derived from deep mutational scanning and single-cell assays.
- Employs Bayesian and other statistical modeling methods for deriving scores (though Bayesian aspect is generalized).

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on experimental deep mutational learning combining high-throughput functional assays with computational models for variant effect prediction.
- It centers on deriving functional scores from molecular measurements within engineered model systems (cell models with introduced variants), rather than integrating prior genome-wide pathogenicity probabilities with observed patient genotype data.
- There is no explicit mention or demonstration of computing genome-wide prior probabilities under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium for all genes and integrating these priors with observed true positive and false negative probabilities per patient.
- Does not describe Bayesian posterior probability estimation of a **complete genetic diagnosis** incorporating (TP/FN/FP/TN) variant observation classes or credible intervals of diagnosis certainty.
- Lacks the stepwise integration of prior probabilities, observed patient variant data, and missing data into a formal Bayesian framework specific to clinical diagnosis confidence.
- The focus is on variant-level functional impact prediction, not the estimation of gene-level or genome-wide diagnostic certainty.
- While statistical learning and deep mutational data integration are core, the concept of modeling false negative probabilities explicitly to infer unobserved pathogenic variants or to produce a posterior diagnostic probability is absent.
- Does not appear to incorporate mode of inheritance (autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked) into modeling variant observation probabilities in a diagnostic context.
- The complexity of integrating population frequency priors with real patient variant calls towards computing diagnostic certainty is a distinct feature of Quant, absent here.
- Lacks explicit modeling of TP, FN, TN, FP categories per patient genome; focuses on variant functional effect prediction.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
This patent relates to an integrated experimental and computational framework for variant functional impact prediction using deep mutational assays and machine learning. While sharing the use of molecular signals, phenotype scores, and advanced statistical learning, it does not overlap with Quantâ€™s core innovation of calculating genome-wide prior probabilities of pathogenic variant presence using population genetics principles, and integrating these priors with observed and missing variant calls in patients to compute a Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis with credible intervals. The patent focuses predominantly on variant-level functional classification within model systems rather than directly modeling diagnostic certainty with TP/FN considerations across the genome. Thus, despite superficial methodological similarities (statistical learning, use of molecular data), the patent does not block the unique claims and approach of Quant.
