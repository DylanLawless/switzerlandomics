#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention relates to a test method for hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasia in dogs and its use (confirmed diagnosis, risk diagnosis, etc.). The inventors identified two germline point mutations (c.462A>T; c.463A>T) in exon 4 of the canine APC gene specific to affected Jack Russell terriers and established nucleic acid detection methods (PCR, sequencing, allele-specific hybridization) to enable both definitive diagnosis and risk assessment of this hereditary disease."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Detection of specific pathogenic germline variants (two point mutations in APC gene) causative for a hereditary disease.
- Use of nucleic acid samples from the subject (dog) for variant detection (e.g., PCR amplification, sequencing).
- Providing diagnostic and risk information based on presence/absence of detected pathogenic variants.
- Objective genetic diagnosis and risk assessment for inherited disease.
- Use of specific primers/probes designed for hybridization and amplification to detect known mutations.
- Testing includes differentiation between wild type and mutant alleles at specific nucleotide positions.

#### Key Differences

- This patent focuses exclusively on detecting two specific germline mutations (c.462A>T and c.463A>T) in the APC gene in a particular dog breed (Jack Russell Terrier) causing a breed-specific hereditary gastrointestinal tumor.
- It is a direct mutation detection method (PCR, sequencing, hybridization) aimed at confirming presence or absence of these known mutations, used for diagnosis or risk determination based on mutation status.
- It does not describe genome-wide prior probability modeling, integration of population allele frequencies, or statistical modeling of variant observation probabilities under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
- The patent does not include computation of Bayesian posterior probabilities that integrate prior probabilities with observed/missing variant data to estimate diagnostic confidence.
- No mention or implication of integrating false negative rates or accounting for missing variant observations in a probabilistic framework.
- The system is a targeted genetic test for known mutations rather than a genome-wide probabilistic diagnosis platform.
- Focus is exclusively veterinary medicine and breed-specific hereditary disorder, without extending to human clinical variant interpretation or broad genomic analyses.
- No use or mention of credible intervals or uncertainty quantification for genome-wide diagnosis confidence.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
This patent claims a genetic test for detecting two specific APC gene mutations causing hereditary gastrointestinal neoplasia in a specific dog breed. It uses standard molecular biology methods (PCR, sequencing, allele-specific probes) to detect known mutations and determine disease presence or risk. It lacks any genome-wide probabilistic framework, prior probability modeling, or Bayesian integration of observed/missing variant data to quantify diagnostic certaintyâ€”core innovations of Quant. Thus, it does not block Quant's technology focused on genome-wide variant probability and Bayesian diagnosis confidence estimation.
