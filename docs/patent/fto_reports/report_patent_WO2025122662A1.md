#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A method of identifying a variant as a somatic variant derived from cell free DNA (cfDNA) identifies the variant at a locus based on differences between the nucleic acid sequence for a cfDNA fragment in a plurality of cfDNA fragments and a nucleic acid sequence for the locus in a reference sequence... A variant allele fraction (VAF) is determined... The fragment length metrics, VAF, and hematopoiesis metrics are inputted into a model thereby obtaining... whether the variant is a somatic variant derived from cfDNA."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses cfDNA fragment sequencing from liquid biopsies to identify somatic variants.
- Models employ fragment length metrics (distribution statistics like median, skew, kurtosis) for cfDNA fragments with the candidate variant.
- Calculates variant allele fraction (VAF) based on reads supporting variant/reference alleles.
- Obtains clonal hematopoiesis prevalence metrics (CHIP likelihood) for variants from cohort data, including solid tumor prevalence.
- Uses supervised learning models (random forests, gradient boosting, XGBoost) trained on matched liquid biopsy and solid tumor/germline data to classify variants as somatic or non-somatic (CHIP/germline).
- Model incorporates integration of fragment length features, VAF, ctDNA tumor fraction estimates, and CHIP likelihood to output probabilistic classification.
- Estimates circulating tumor fraction (ctFE) using bioinformatic off-target reads, expectation-maximization fitting, and other methods.
- Considers variant allele fraction residuals relative to modeled expected VAF given circulating tumor fraction.
- Extensive bioinformatics pipeline includes preprocessing, alignment, deduplication including use of UMIs, variant calling (e.g., VarDict), copy number analysis (e.g., CNVkit), structural variant analysis, and variant annotation.
- Reports generated including classification of variants into actionable, biologically relevant, VUS, or benign, predictive of treatment outcomes.
- Focus on improving discrimination of somatic variants from CHIP to avoid false positives in liquid biopsy based diagnostics.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on distinguishing somatic variants from clonal hematopoiesis variants in liquid biopsy assays by applying a machine learning model using fragment length distribution, CHIP prevalence, VAF, and ctDNA fraction.
- Quant’s core innovation is calculating genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants (hardy-Weinberg equilibrium based) and integrating both observed and unobserved (false negative) data into a Bayesian posterior of complete genetic diagnosis confidence. 
- This patent does not explicitly quantify false negative probabilities or integrate prior probabilities of variant occurrence genome-wide to compute credible intervals over whole-gene or genome diagnostic certainty.
- The patent primarily addresses filtering/clasification of detected variants in cell-free DNA focused on somatic vs hematopoietic origin, i.e., classification of detected candidate variants.
- Quant differs by estimating prior probabilities for disease-causing variant occurrence genome-wide, and integrating observed variant calls together with false negative modeling for a Bayesian posterior diagnosis probability.
- The patent uses a random forest or similar classifier trained on fragment lengths and prevalence features to label individual variants, as opposed to Quant’s theoretical framework quantifying the confidence of complete genetic diagnosis incorporating TP, FN, TN, FP at genome-wide scale.
- The patented method is a machine learning variant classification approach focused on somatic vs CHIP origin, not a model integrating population genetics inheritance models with observed/missing variant data to generate posterior diagnostic probabilities.
- The patent’s use of Bayesian models is focused on filtering sequencing artifacts and variant classification, rather than calculating posterior probabilities of a complete diagnosis.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:**  
Although both Quant and the patent analyze variants detected from cfDNA sequencing and use fragment length metrics, VAF, and machine learning to classify somatic vs clonal hematopoiesis origin, Quant’s innovation lies in genome-wide prior probability estimation integrated with false negative modeling to produce Bayesian posterior probabilities quantifying the confidence in a complete genetic diagnosis. The patent focuses on variant-level classification to distinguish somatic tumor variants from CHIP variants using random forest models, applying population-derived clonal hematopoiesis prevalence frequencies to filter false positives. The patent does not disclose nor claim the core Quant approach of mapping prior probabilities genome-wide under inheritance models, nor integrating unobserved variant probabilities to generate credible intervals on diagnostic certainty. Therefore, the patent’s scope does not block Quant’s unique theoretical framework and application.

# Summary

The analyzed patent WO2025122662A1 discloses methods for classifying somatic variants derived from cfDNA (liquid biopsy) by integrating fragment length metrics, variant allele fractions, clonal hematopoiesis prevalence, and tumor fraction estimates in a machine learning model to distinguish somatic tumor variants from CHIP variants. Quant’s technology, in contrast, computes genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variant occurrence under inheritance modes and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, explicitly models false negatives/missing variants, and produces Bayesian posterior probabilities and credible intervals expressing confidence in the completeness and accuracy of a patient’s genetic diagnosis across all genes.

The patent’s approach focuses on variant-level classification of somatic vs CHIP variants in cfDNA sequencing data using random forest classifiers trained on fragment length and prevalence features, but does not teach or claim Quant’s genome-wide prior probability integration and diagnostic posterior probability framework. Thus, the patent may share some superficial data analysis concepts (e.g., use of fragment length, VAF, Bayesian filtering on read-level artifacts), but does not involve or overlap with Quant’s central innovation of generating a posterior probability of a complete diagnosis by integrating prior probabilities and false negative modeling genome-wide.

Accordingly, this patent is **not blocking for Quant** in terms of freedom-to-operate for Quant’s unique genome-wide Bayesian diagnostic certainty estimation technology.
