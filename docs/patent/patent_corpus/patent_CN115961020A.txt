Background High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) is a serious acute altitude disease. The disease usually occurs in the plateau of the person who enters the plateau at first or then, and means that the organism rapidly enters the area with the altitude of more than 3000m and cannot adapt to the plateau idiopathic disease caused by the low-pressure oxygen-poor environment of the plateau. The disease is emergent, the disease condition develops quickly, a series of symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, lung wheezy phlegm, a large amount of pink foam phlegm, lung moist rale with different degrees and the like are clinically manifested on the surface, the disease develops quickly, and the life safety of plateau personnel is seriously threatened.

HAPE disease-associated single nucleotide site validation 2.1 selection of candidate SNPs Selecting 37 SNPs in 9 genes of the CYP family based on research results published by an applicant group in HAPE genetic risk research; 49 SNPs in 17 genes of the MIR family; 45 SNPs in 8 genes of the IL family; 43 SNPs in 14 genes of telomere; 70 SNPs in the other 22 genes related to HAPE disease. See table 1 for details. TABLE 1 candidate SNPs information 2.3 candidate SNPs site primer design PCR amplification primers and single-base extension primers of candidate SNPs sites are designed by adopting the Agena Bioscience Assay Design Suite V2.0 software Design. TABLE 1 primer information for candidate SNPs 2.4 genotyping The locus of HAPE disease-associated SNPs was genotyped in all subject DNA samples using the Agena MassARRAY SNP typing technique. 2.5 statistical analysis The SNPs typing off-machine data were collated in Excel sheets for further analysis. These collated data were then statistically analyzed using span 22.0. The control group Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was analyzed by the chi-square test. p is a radical of>0.05 indicates that the control group reaches genetic equilibrium, which indicates that the data of the control group is credible, and vice versa, indicates that Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is not satisfied, and the locus needs to be removed. Then, logistic regression analysis is applied to correct the influence of the confounding factors on the HAPE, and the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval are calculated for evaluating the disease risk of the single nucleotide polymorphism and the HAPE, if OR>1 indicates a risk factor, if OR<1, the protection function. Selection of p<5×10 -6 As a threshold for significance of SNPs. The HAPE disease-associated SNPs sites are shown in table 2. TABLE 2 SNPs sites associated with HAPE disease HAPE risk prediction model construction and internal verification 4.1HAPE Risk factor screening and model construction 4.1.1 data preprocessing Dependent variable: 'is HAPE present? ', yes and no are represented by 1 and 0, respectively. The independent variable is as follows: the number of alleles at sites associated with HAPE diseases is G (0,1,2) which indicates the number of alleles at risk for carrying the SNP site in each person, i.e., 2 indicates AA,1 indicates AB, and 0 indicates BB (A is the minimum allele and B is the maximum allele). 4.1.2HAPE Risk prediction model construction The most valuable prediction factors are screened by adopting a Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) mathematical logistic regression method. Lasso is a contraction estimation method, and the basic idea is to minimize the sum of squares of residuals under the constraint condition that the sum of absolute values of regression coefficients is less than a constant, so that some regression coefficients strictly equal to 0 can be generated, and the purpose of screening the most valuable risk factors is achieved. The degree of Lasso regression complexity adjustment is controlled by the parameter lambda (λ) coefficient. The compression degree of the model variable changes along with the difference of the values of the lambda coefficients, namely, the number of variables selected by the model is reduced along with the increase of the estimated value of the lambda. For the parameter lambda value in the model, the setting algorithm automatically selects 100 different lambda values, fits out the model with different coefficients, and then draws a coefficient path diagram. And obtaining the optimal lambda coefficient in the Lasso regression by adopting a cross verification method, namely a process of determining the optimal penalty coefficient by using a Lasso regression model. A series of different lambda values were fitted using the glmnet () function, using the 'glmnet' package for the R language. And then, estimating a penalty coefficient lambda by adopting a 10-time cross verification method, and selecting the minimum error value as the penalty coefficient lambda of the model, thereby constructing an optimal HAPE genetic risk prediction model. And (3) a 10-time cross validation method, namely taking the data of one group in the sample as a test set, taking the other 9 groups as a training set, and circulating the steps until each group is taken as the test set, taking the mean square error as a longitudinal coordinate and selecting a parameter standard to obtain a lambda cross validation result (figure 1). The function used is cv. Glmnet (), and for each lambda value we can obtain a confidence interval for the target parameter. Two preferred lambda values are obtained, one of which is lambda.min, which is the one that yields the minimum mean value of the target parameter among all the lambda values. The other is lambda.1se, which refers to the lambda value that gives the simplest model within a variance of lambda.min. After the lambda value reaches a certain value, the number of independent variables of the model is increased continuously, namely the lambda value is reduced, so that the performance of the model cannot be improved remarkably, and lambda.1se provides the model with excellent performance but the number of the independent variables is the minimum. We used lambda.1se as the lambda value for the constructed model. The regression coefficients for the Lasso analysis were used to create model coefficients for each sample using the following formula Risk Score = β 1G1+ β 2G2+ β 3G3+ … … β nGn. 'β' is the regression coefficient for the SNP and 'G' is the number of alleles at risk that carry the SNP. We adopted lambda.1se as the lambda value of the constructed model, i.e. lambda =0.019; as shown in FIG. 2, 20 SNPs sites on 15 genes were co-screened (rs 2280274, rs7554283, rs6713088, rs17045754, rs2072472, rs275651, rs4524238, rs385338, rs1042718, rs353299, rs1524107, rs749174, rs4963516, rs7318578, rs17735387, rs4591246, rs3093193, rs3093110, rs1038376, rs 6010621). And (3) taking 20 polymorphic loci as final prediction factors and building a model. 13 HAPE protective SNPs sites and 7 dangerous SNPs sites. The 7 dangerous SNPs sites are as follows: rs4591246, rs17735387, rs6713088, rs1042718, rs1524107, rs1038376, rs4524238. The 13 HAPE protective SNPs sites are as follows: rs6010621, rs7554283, rs17045754, rs4963516, rs7318578, rs3093110, rs2280274, rs2072472, rs385338, rs3093193, rs353299, rs749174, rs275651. The results of the Lasso regression analysis were used as regression coefficients for the constructed model. The statistical formula is as follows: risk Score = β 1G1+ β 2G2+ β 3G3+ … … β nGn. 'β' is the regression coefficient for the SNP and 'G' is the number of alleles at risk that carry the SNP. G (0,1,2) indicates the number of risk alleles carrying the SNP site in each individual, i.e., 2 indicates AA,1 indicates AB,0 indicates BB (A is the minimum allele and B is the reference allele), and the information on the beta values of 20 SNP sites is shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 beta value information for 20 SNP sites A plateau pulmonary edema morbidity risk prediction model is established based on the method. In popularization and application, the individual is subjected to genotype detection, a risk prediction model of the plateau pulmonary edema is incorporated according to the individual genotype, and the risk score of the individual is calculated, so that the total occurrence risk of the individual is quantified. Risk Score＝0.084G 1 +0.105G 2 +0.106G 3 +0.117G 4 +0.174G 5 +0.186G 6 + 0.234G 7 -0.426G 8 -0.257G 9 -0.206G 10 -0.193G 11 -0.188G 12 -0.167G 13 -0.143G 14 -0.140G 15 -0.133G 16 -0.075G 17 -0.065G 18 -0.020G 19 -0.013G 20 。 Risk Score was calculated based on SNPs locus genotype correspondence scores of HAPE case group and control group, and Risk stratification criteria were: when the RiskScore > -0.14 is judged to be a high-risk group, when-0.45 but not more than-0.15 RiskScore are judged to be an intermediate-risk group, and when the RiskScore is not more than-0.45, the RiskScore is judged to be a low-risk group. 4.2 internal validation of HAPE Risk prediction model (1) C-statistics (C-statistics): AUC (Area Under Current) is defined as the value of the Area formed between the ROC Curve (Receiver Operating Characteristic Current) and the X-axis. The ROC curve is also known as the receiver operating characteristic curve and the susceptibility curve. And marking corresponding points of the X axis and the Y axis in a first quadrant with specificity and sensitivity, and connecting the corresponding points by using a broken line to obtain an ROC curve, wherein each point on the ROC curve represents the response to the same signal stimulus under different judgment standards. The AUC value must be equal to or less than 1 and greater than 0.5, with values closer to 1 indicating that the model works better and the results are more realistic. Generally, the AUC is lower at 0.50-0.70; between 0.71 and 0.90, and the like; whereas above 0.90 is a high accuracy. Consider a dichotomy problem, i.e., classifying instances into positive (positive) or negative (negative) classes. For a dichotomy problem, four cases occur. 1) True class (TP), instances are positive classes and are also predicted as positive classes; 2) False positive class (FP), an instance is a negative class predicted to be a positive class; 3) True negative classes (TN), instances are negative classes predicted to be negative; 4) False Negative (FN) class, a positive class is predicted to be a negative class, and a false negative class. Specificity on the X-axis and sensitivity on the Y-axis (1) Sensitivity (true positive): is completely equivalent to the recall rate, and means that in the case of actually positive cases, the correct proportion is predicted. The formula: TP/(TP + FN) (2) Specificity (false positive probability): the proportion formula of the case with the wrong prediction as positive in the case with the actual negative is shown as follows: FP/(FP + TN) And marking the corresponding points of the two in the first quadrant, and connecting by using a broken line to obtain the ROC curve. It is known that setting different probability threshold values will make the prediction classification of positive and negative cases different in the data set, so as to obtain different confusion matrix, and thus obtain different sensitivity and specificity. As the sensitivity of the recipient increases, the number of false positives increases. The model was written using the glm function using the 'rms' package in the R language, and the C-statistic for each model was calculated. As shown in fig. 3, the AUC value of the HAPE risk prediction model established by analyzing this item is 0.716, the specificity (FRP) is 0.651, and the sensitivity (TPR) is 0.702, which indicates that the model can achieve the prediction performance of HAPE. (2) Calibration (Calibration) evaluation of the prediction model: the calibration degree can reflect the absolute difference between the predicted value and the true value, namely the consistency between the predicted risk and the actual risk of a certain model, and a good risk prediction model has higher discrimination and calibration degrees. Calibration curve (Calibration curve) evaluation of HAPE risk prediction model: the calibration curve is a calibration, i.e., a degree of calibration, performed on each model based on a correspondence between the model predicted risk and the validation queue actual value. And (3) using a 'calibre' function of an R language, performing 1000 times of repeated sampling on the verification data set to eliminate selective bias, drawing a calibration curve of each model, and evaluating the calibration degree of each model by observing the calibration curve. The ordinate is the actual probability: actual incidence of events in the patient. The abscissa is the prediction probability: and constructing a model to predict the disease probability of the patient. The diagonal dotted line represents the perfect prediction of the ideal model, i.e. the prediction probability is the same as the actual result, the closer the prediction is fitted to the diagonal dotted line, the better the prediction effect. The calibration plots show that the predicted results are consistent with the observed results (fig. 4). In conclusion, the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the True Positive Rate (TPR), the True Negative Rate (TNR) and the calibration curve of the model are respectively calculated, so that the HAPE risk prediction technology established by the project has better early disease risk prediction capability. 4.3 visual Nomogram mapping of HAPE Risk prediction model The Nomogram is also called No Mo Tu (Nomogram graph), and the basic construction idea is to draw a visualization graph according to a complex regression model and the proportion of regression coefficients. The nomogram drawing process comprises the steps of firstly determining the value range of each independent variable in proportion according to the contribution degree of each independent variable in a complex model to a dependent variable, namely the size of a beta coefficient corresponding to each variable in a regression model, then assigning scores to the value level of each independent variable, finally adding the scores of each variable to obtain a total score, and finally calculating the survival risk probability prediction value of the patient according to the probability conversion relation between the total score and an ending variable. The result of the genotype test of the testee is scored, a total score can be calculated by accumulation, and the outcome occurrence probability of each HAPE patient is calculated by a conversion function between the score and the outcome occurrence probability. The HAPE genetic risk prediction model was visualized by the 'Nomogram' functional package in R language (fig. 5). And constructing a model through Lasso-Logistic regression, assigning scores to each value level of each influence factor according to the contribution degree (the size of a regression coefficient) of each influence factor in the model to the outcome variable, then adding the scores to obtain a total score, and finally calculating the predicted value of the individual outcome event through the function conversion relation between the total score and the occurrence probability of the outcome event.
