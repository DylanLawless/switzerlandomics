#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A method may include generating multiple virtual progenies from multiple first virtual gametes and multiple second virtual gametes. Each virtual progeny may combine one of the first virtual gametes and one of the second virtual gametes. ... A computing server may input, for each virtual progeny, data associated with the first virtual gamete ... to a machine learning model to determine a first variant-specific gene dysfunction score corresponding to a target allele site. ... The computing server may derive, for each virtual progeny, a dysfunction likelihood score of the target allele site from the first variant-specific gene dysfunction score and the second variant-specific gene dysfunction score."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses virtual progenies generated by combining virtual gametes from two potential parents to simulate possible offspring genomes.
- Applies a neural network-based machine learning model to compute variant-specific gene dysfunction (VGD) scores for variants at given allele sites.
- Combines variant dysfunction scores of parental alleles to derive a dysfunction likelihood score representing the genotype's disease risk.
- Uses continuous trait models to quantify partial functionality or partial disease risk, not just binary classification.
- Generates distributions of dysfunction likelihoods by simulating many virtual progenies, enabling assessment of disease risk and confidence intervals.
- Incorporates multiple gene dysfunction components including clinical variant classifications, evolutionary constraint, population allele frequencies, mutation class, and pathogenic predictors.
- Explicitly models homozygous and heterozygous effects and dominant effects in population-based scoring.
- Uses evolutionary models and population-specific data to improve accuracy of variant pathogenicity and gene dysfunction likelihood.
- Employs Bayesian or neural network approaches to integrate prior probabilities with variant data to estimate probability of a genetic diagnosis.
- Can predict likelihood of disease in unobserved, preconception virtual offspring accounting for false negatives and unseen variants.
- Provides continuous scoring with credible intervals reflecting diagnostic certainty.

#### Key Differences

- None significant with respect to the core technical innovation described.
- The patent focuses heavily on a multi-node neural network combining diverse sources of evidence for variant dysfunction; this is a fundamental underpinning of Quant.
- Detailed population- and evolutionary-selection metrics and integration with clinical data aligns closely with Quant.
- The patent does not merely predict pathogenicity labels but models the likelihood of allele- and genotype-specific dysfunction, similar to Quant's core focus.
- The use of virtual progeny and integration of multiple gene dysfunction components including population selection, evolutionary constraint, and clinical classification closely resembles Quant’s unique method.
- While the patent cites its neural network and Bayesian integration, specific implementation details might differ but the underlying theory and method have strong parallels.

#### Conclusion

Potential overlap — recommend legal review.

**Summary:**  
This patent describes technology that is highly similar to the Quant platform in using multi-source Bayesian/neural network integration of variant-specific dysfunction scores, evolutionary and population metrics, and clinical data to assess the likelihood of gene dysfunction and disease in simulated progeny. Both rely on generating virtual progeny by recombination of parental gametes, scoring dysfunction scores for each allele, and computing genotype dysfunction likelihoods in a continuous and probabilistic framework. It also uniquely integrates false negative probability and credible intervals for diagnosis confidence. Given the very close theoretical and technical correspondence—especially focusing on TP, FN scenarios, detailed population genetics, Bayesian models, and genotype functionality—there is significant potential overlap with Quant’s technology.
