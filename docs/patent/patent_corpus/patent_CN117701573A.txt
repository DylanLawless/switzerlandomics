Description Translated from Chinese 核酸突变体及其应用Nucleic acid mutants and their applications 技术领域Technical field 本申请涉及基因工程技术领域，具体地，涉及核酸突变体及其应用。更具体地，涉及一种核酸、蛋白质及其在制备试剂盒中的用途、用于筛选患患耳聋的生物样品的试剂盒、构建体、重组细胞、生物模型在筛选药物中的用途、用于治疗耳聋的药物。This application relates to the field of genetic engineering technology, specifically to nucleic acid mutants and their applications. More specifically, it relates to a nucleic acid, protein and their use in preparing kits, kits for screening biological samples suffering from deafness, constructs, recombinant cells, and the use of biological models in screening drugs. Medications to treat deafness. 背景技术Background technique 在现代医学领域，耳聋(Hearing Loss,HL)是一种十分常见且严重的感官功能障碍，其发病原因多种多样，其中相当一部分患者的耳聋与遗传因素密切相关。通过基因检测手段深入研究耳聋的分子机制，努力寻求降低耳聋发病率的方法，这不仅为产前基因诊断和干预措施提供了有效依据，也为耳聋的预防和治疗提供了根本途径。In the field of modern medicine, deafness (Hearing Loss, HL) is a very common and serious sensory dysfunction with various causes, and the deafness of a considerable number of patients is closely related to genetic factors. In-depth research on the molecular mechanism of deafness through genetic testing methods and efforts to find ways to reduce the incidence of deafness not only provide effective basis for prenatal genetic diagnosis and intervention measures, but also provide a fundamental way for the prevention and treatment of deafness. 遗传性耳聋可以根据患者是否伴有其他临床症状分为综合征型耳聋(SyndromicHearing Loss,SHL)和非综合征型耳聋(Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss,NSHL)。其中，非综合征型耳聋占据了先天性遗传性耳聋的绝大多数，其中又有相当比例的病例为常染色体隐性遗传(Autosomal Recessive,AR)。PTPRQ基因位于染色体12的q21.31区域，包含着47个外显子。PTPRQ基因的突变与常染色体隐性遗传非综合型耳聋(Autosomal Recessive Non-Syndromic Hearing Loss,ARNSHL)有关，患者的临床症状主要表现为耳聋、前庭异常以及语言发育滞后。Hereditary deafness can be divided into syndromic hearing loss (SHL) and non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) according to whether the patient is accompanied by other clinical symptoms. Among them, non-syndromic deafness accounts for the vast majority of congenital hereditary deafness, and a considerable proportion of cases are autosomal recessive (AR). The PTPRQ gene is located in the q21.31 region of chromosome 12 and contains 47 exons. Mutations in the PTPRQ gene are related to autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL). The patient's clinical symptoms mainly include deafness, vestibular abnormalities, and delayed language development. 然而，不同的致病基因导致的非综合征型耳聋在发病年龄、听力损失程度、病情进展等方面表现出显著差异。因此，准确确定导致耳聋的致病基因对于为患者选择合适的听力干预手段至关重要，这不仅能够提高治疗的有效性，还能够显著提升患者的生活质量。However, non-syndromic deafness caused by different pathogenic genes shows significant differences in age of onset, degree of hearing loss, and disease progression. Therefore, accurately identifying the causative genes that cause deafness is crucial to selecting appropriate hearing interventions for patients, which can not only improve the effectiveness of treatment, but also significantly improve the quality of life of patients. 发明内容Contents of the invention 本发明旨在至少解决现有技术中存在的技术问题之一。为此，本发明的一个目的在于提出一种能够有效筛选患有耳聋的生物样品的手段。The present invention aims to solve at least one of the technical problems existing in the prior art. To this end, one object of the present invention is to provide a means for effectively screening biological samples suffering from deafness. 在基因组学领域，全外显子测序(Whole-Exome Sequencing，WES)被广泛应用于基因变异的鉴定。外显子是人类基因组中蛋白质编码的区域，尽管它只占据整个基因组的约1％，但却包含了约85％的致病突变。通过序列捕获技术，外显子DNA能够被有效捕获和富集。与全基因组测序相比，全外显子测序更加经济高效，被广泛用于研究与疾病、种群进化相关的编码区及UTR区域内的突变。In the field of genomics, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is widely used to identify genetic variations. Exons are protein-coding regions in the human genome, and although they only occupy about 1% of the entire genome, they contain about 85% of disease-causing mutations. Through sequence capture technology, exonic DNA can be effectively captured and enriched. Compared with whole-genome sequencing, whole-exome sequencing is more cost-effective and is widely used to study mutations in coding regions and UTR regions related to diseases and population evolution. 基于上述技术发展，发明人针对自行收集的一例耳聋Trio家系(包括父母和患者)，运用全外显子测序、家系分析以及Sanger测序验证的方法进行了致病变异检测。同时，利用公共数据库提供的外显子数据，更好地解释所得突变与疾病的关系。Based on the above technological development, the inventor used whole-exome sequencing, family analysis, and Sanger sequencing verification methods to detect pathogenic variants in a self-collected deafness Trio family (including parents and patients). At the same time, exome data provided by public databases are used to better explain the relationship between the obtained mutations and the disease. 在研究中，发明人成功确定了一个新的致病突变位点——PTPRQ基因的c.1069delC突变。此外，该突变与患者另一条染色体上同一基因的c.5942+1G>A突变构成了复合杂合(in trans)，共同导致了常染色体隐性非综合征型耳聋的发病。During the research, the inventors successfully identified a new pathogenic mutation site - the c.1069delC mutation of the PTPRQ gene.

The sequence is used as a reference sequence to help obtain more accurate sequence analysis results in the future. In the embodiment of the present application, the sample to be tested comes from the human body, and the reference sequence is the human reference genome or the human autosomal genome. 在本申请中，所使用的野生型PTPRQ基因序列位置是以人类基因组中野生型PTPRQ基因的序列为准，但当该野生型RAD50基因存在于其他物种中时，该序列可能会有差异，可通过将该物种的野生型PTPRQ基因与人野生型PTPRQ基因进行比对获得该物种的野生型PTPRQ基因中所对应的位置。在本申请中，发明人发现了导致常染色体隐性耳聋的新致病突变位点，即PTPRQ基因的突变。该突变位点可以用于对常染色体隐性耳聋患者进行分子诊断，也可以用于与相关疾病(如遗传性听力损失疾病或药物引起的耳聋)进行鉴别诊断。这种基因检测方法快速、准确、高效、简便，具有较高的早期诊断率。In this application, the sequence position of the wild-type PTPRQ gene used is based on the sequence of the wild-type PTPRQ gene in the human genome.

The family diagram is shown in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 1, this family contains three members. The daughter is deaf (i.e., II-1 in the family diagram) and the parents are normal (i.e., I-1 and I-2 in the family diagram). Among them, the solid icon is the patient, and the arrow points to the proband. 该家系中患者的听力结果见图2。在图2中，横坐标表示听力的频率，纵坐标表示听力级别，如果听力正常，阈值曲线应该是在0附近浮动。如图2所示，听力图提示患者II-1双耳极重度耳聋。The hearing results of the patients in this family are shown in Figure 2.
