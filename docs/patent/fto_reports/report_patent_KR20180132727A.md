#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Methods and systems for generating and analyzing the results of genetic variant-phenotype associations are disclosed. [...] The present invention provides an integrated electronic system including genetic data components, phenotype data components, automated gene variant-phenotype association result data components, automated result data analysis components, and interfaces, to facilitate storage, processing, analysis, output, and visualization of biological data."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Integral use of genetic variant data and phenotypic data from patients to perform large-scale gene variant–phenotype association studies.
- Use of Bayesian/statistical methods for association analyses including GWAS, PheWAS, and burden tests.
- Generation of numerical measures of association strength between variants and phenotypes.
- Use of various data inputs such as gnomAD/ExAC (population frequencies), ClinVar (pathogenicity annotations), panel gene lists (inheritance modes).
- Aggregation of variant-level probabilities into gene-level and disease-level probabilities.
- Focus on rare and common variant effects, including loss-of-function (pLoF) variants.
- Application in clinical genomics, drug target identification, and disease burden studies.
- Modeling of cosegregation of variants in families, reconstructing pedigrees from genomic data.
- Transparent handling of true positives, false negatives in variant detection with quality control measures.
- Outputs include credible intervals and quantified uncertainty in diagnosis.

#### Key Differences

- The patent’s disclosed system emphasizes large-scale *association studies* and data integration to generate genetic variant-phenotype association results and facilitate their visualization and exploration.
- While Bayesian or probabilistic models may be implemented internally, the patent does not specifically claim or emphasize the unique concept of integrating prior gene-level pathogenic variant probabilities with observed and unobserved patient variant data to derive a *Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis*, including explicit modeling of false negatives and credible intervals for diagnostic *certainty*, which are central to Quant’s novelty.
- The patent broadly covers variant annotation, genotyping analysis, pedigree reconstruction, and statistical association methods but focuses on the generation and management of association data rather than directly quantifying diagnostic certainty accounting for false negatives/false positives.
- The Bayesian framework outlined by Quant, centered on prior probabilities, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium modeling, and posterior diagnostic certainty estimation using patient-specific true/false positive/negative modeling, is not explicitly disclosed or closely mirrored.
- The patent mentions many common resources and methods (gnomAD, ClinVar, Exome Aggregation data, standard genetic analyses), which are also public knowledge and do not resemble Quant’s unique Bayesian diagnostic framework.
- The patent’s clinical applications include genome-wide association, drug target nomination, and genotype-phenotype mappings but do not specifically claim the Bayesian integration of prior genome-wide variant occurrence probabilities with patient-level observed and missing data to compute diagnostic confidence intervals.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

The patent discloses broad computational frameworks for integrating genetic variant and phenotype data at population scale, pedigree reconstruction, and association analysis. However, it lacks disclosure or claims on the unique Bayesian modeling of diagnostic certainty central to Quant, specifically the integration of prior genome-wide pathogenic variant probabilities with patient true positives and unobserved false negatives to yield a posterior probability with credible intervals. Thus, while sharing technical domains and some overlap in general approaches (variant annotation, association studies), the patent does not closely resemble the theory or method of Quant that focuses on posterior probability of genetic diagnosis accounting for false negatives.

# Short Summary

- The patent describes a system that performs genome-wide variant-phenotype association studies, integration of genetic and phenotype data, pedigree reconstruction, and visualization.
- Many public datasets and variant annotation methods are mentioned.
- Statistical methods (e.g., GWAS, PheWAS, burden tests) and standard pipelines for variant calling, CNV detection, and pedigree building are included.
- Unknown/negative variants and their impact on diagnostic confidence are not modeled in a Bayesian posterior diagnostic probability framework as in Quant.
- Quant’s core novelty — Bayesian inference combining genome-wide prior probabilities with clinical observed and missing variant data (TP, FN) to quantify complete genetic diagnosis certainty — is not claimed or described.
- Overlaps exist in general domain and data inputs but not in the unique Quant innovation.
- Therefore, the patent is **not blocking** for Quant’s Freedom-to-Operate.
