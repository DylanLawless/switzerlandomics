#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Provided is a comprehensive, scalable, biotechnology solution that solves diagnostic and therapeutic complications in rapidly progressive childhood genetic diseases. As such, the invention provides Genome-to-Treatment (GTRxSM), which is an automated, virtual system for genetic disease diagnosis and acute management guidance."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Automated extraction of comprehensive clinical phenotypes (phenome) from electronic medical records using clinical natural language processing (CNLP) and translation into standardized vocabularies like Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO).  
- Generation of ranked differential diagnosis lists based on integration of patient phenotypes and genomic variant data.  
- Utilization of whole genome or exome sequencing data for identifying genetic variants and rank ordering potential diagnoses.  
- Use of Bayesian models and machine learning tools (MOON™, GEM™, TruSight™) for variant pathogenicity prediction and phenotypic fit scoring.  
- Automated provisional diagnosis with quantification of likelihood rankings.  
- Integration of treatment efficacy, evidence quality, contraindications, and expert-adjudicated therapeutic interventions into a decision support system (GTRxSM) that links genetic diagnoses to management guidance.  
- Automated pipelines and software systems for scalable, rapid analysis geared towards pediatric and neonatal intensive care populations with rapidly progressive genetic diseases.  
- Incorporation of diagnostic uncertainty through variant classification (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS) and comprehensive phenotypic data extraction.  
- Explicit inclusion of copy number variants (CNVs) and structural variants (SVs) in the variant calling and interpretation pipeline.  
- Sequential filtering and ranking steps that connect phenotype data, genotype data, and known disease associations to produce diagnostic candidates and treatment recommendations.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses primarily on an automated pipeline for diagnosis and management guidance emphasizing automated extraction of phenotype features, ranking differential genetic diagnoses based on phenotype-genotype integration, and linking diagnoses to expert-curated treatment guidance.  
- Quant’s key innovation lies in explicitly quantifying disease-causing variant **prior probabilities genome-wide**, integrating **true positive and false negative probabilities** from observed and absent variant data in the patient genome, and computing a **Bayesian posterior probability that the patient truly carries a disease-causing variant** causally linked to the disease with credible intervals reflecting diagnostic certainty. This precise probabilistic modeling of variant observation probabilities and diagnostic confidence is distinct.  
- The patent does not describe modeling or explicitly integrating false negative probabilities, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium-based variant occurrence probabilities, or genome-wide prior probabilities as core to the method.  
- The patent relies on phenotypic feature extraction, variant annotation/classification, and literature/database-based pathogenicity scoring combined with ranking algorithms and AI tools but does not explicitly claim the formal probabilistic framework for disease diagnosis confidence emphasizing TP/FN modeling at the genome-wide level.  
- Treatment guidance is a primary focus of this invention, whereas Quant’s innovation centers on quantifying diagnostic certainty rather than treatment per se.  
- Although Bayesian models are mentioned for filtering and ranking variants, these appear focused on variant pathogenicity and phenotype matching rather than integrating genome-wide prior probabilities and adjustment for missing/unobserved variants with credible intervals as in Quant.  
- The scope is largely in acute, rapid diagnosis for ICU or neonatal intensive care patients with rapid turnaround times (~13.5 to 20 hours), emphasizing operational scalability and clinical workflow; Quant focuses more broadly on a genome-wide variant probability platform aimed at clinical diagnostic certainty and research use.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** While the patent describes an automated genetic disease diagnostic platform leveraging Bayesian and AI methods, CNLP-based phenotyping, variant pathogenicity classification, and integration with treatment guidance, it does not disclose or claim the core theoretical framework central to Quant — namely, the explicit genome-wide prior probability modeling of observing disease-causing variants, incorporation of false negative and true positive variant observation probabilities, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium computations, and producing a Bayesian posterior diagnostic probability with credible intervals quantifying certainty. The use of Bayesian methods for variant/pathogenicity scoring is a common approach and does not equate to Quant’s unique diagnostic confidence modeling. Furthermore, the patent’s focus is on rapid provisional diagnosis coupled with treatment guidance rather than on probabilistic quantification of diagnostic certainty from variant observation probabilities. Hence, there is no close theoretical overlap warranting blocking of Quant’s novel method.
