#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A computer-implemented method for determining the phenotypic impact of molecular variants in model systems including single cells, cellular compartments, or synthetic compartments, by integrating molecular scores, phenotypic scores, molecular signals, population signals, and applying statistical learning techniques (e.g., machine learning) to derive functional scores, evidence scores, and classify variants according to their phenotypic impact."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both the patent and Quant focus on genome-wide, large-scale assessment of molecular variants.
- Use of molecular measurements (e.g., single-cell sequencing data), annotations, and statistical learning/machine learning methods for variant impact prediction.
- Incorporation of functional scores, phenotype scores, evidence scores, and hierarchical modeling layers including functional models and inference models.
- Introduction of credible intervals and uncertainty quantification as part of the variant classification (implied by Bayesian estimation and probabilistic modeling).
- Consideration of multiple molecular and population signals across different cells or compartments in a model system.
- Application of deep mutational learning (DML) to identify pathogenic vs. benign variants with classification performance metrics.
- Use of annotations from population allele frequency databases (e.g., gnomAD), clinical databases (ClinVar), protein structural and functional annotations, and machine learning derived scores.
- Explicit acknowledgment of false negative and positive considerations, including use of multilayer modeling to improve cost efficiency and scalability.
- Detailed stratification of variants by gene, inheritance mode, and incorporation of modes of inheritance.
- Use of Bayesian posterior probabilities and credible intervals for expressing diagnostic certainty, aligning with Quant’s unique feature of quantifying diagnostic confidence rather than only pathogenicity classification.
- Evaluation metrics employed include PPV, NPV, sensitivity, specificity, MCC, and others notably shared with Quant.
- Inclusion of sampling and inference models to handle unknown variant impacts, expanding variant interpretation beyond known datasets.
- Application of multistate learning layers and modeling of variant distributions across different molecular states or conditions.
- Use of hotspot identification and spatial clustering of variants to detect mutationally constrained regions, which are scored and integrated into variant interpretation.

#### Key Differences

- The patent largely emphasizes direct experimental measures (e.g., deep mutational scanning and functional assays in cells) combined with computational deep learning and modeling as a way to generate variant functional scores.
- Quant’s innovation centers more on integrating pre-computed prior probabilities at the genome-wide scale (using population data and functional annotations) with observed/missing variant data at an individual patient level to compute Bayesian posterior probabilities quantifying diagnostic certainty.
- The patent focuses on phenotypic impact prediction of variants primarily in model systems and biological samples with heavy use of experimental data; Quant emphasizes integrating prior probabilities with patient data, and quantifying full diagnostic confidence including false negatives at the clinical interpretation stage.
- The patent discusses multiple layers of variant impact modeling but does not explicitly teach the aggregation of variant-level probabilities into genome-wide diagnostic posteriors with credible intervals as Quant does.
- The patent appears more focused on generating functional scores and molecular phenotypic impact informing variant classification, without explicit Bayesian modeling of complete genetic diagnosis probability across all genes and inheritance modes.
- No explicit disclosure in the patent of false negative modeling for unsequenced or missing variants to estimate undetected pathogenic variants, a key novel feature of Quant.
- Quant specifically integrates population allele frequency distributions under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and inheritance mode for prior probabilities genome-wide, which is not a focus of the patent.
- Quant produces gene and variant level tables ranking disease gene observation probabilities, which is not clearly taught here.
- The patent appears as a platform that includes extensive experimental methods and high-dimensional modeling of molecular and phenotypic states but does not specifically capture the idea of integrating observed TPs and FNs into a Bayesian diagnostic framework for clinical certainty quantification.
- Though Bayesian models are mentioned, the patent’s use is general for feature modeling rather than specifically for integrating prior genome-wide variant probabilities to generate comprehensive diagnostic posteriors.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

While the patent shares overlapping domains—computational learning, variant impact prediction, use of molecular and population data, and assessment of phenotypic impact of variants—its technical approach, focus, and claimed inventive concepts differ significantly from Quant’s unique genome-wide Bayesian posterior probability diagnostic framework that explicitly models observed and missing variants (TP, FN) for clinical diagnosis confidence. The patent emphasizes deep mutational learning integrating experimental and computational data, whereas Quant’s novelty lies in probabilistic modeling of full genetic diagnosis certainty from prior probabilities and patient data.

# Summary

- The JP7316270B2 patent applies integrated computational and experimental deep mutational learning to predict molecular variant phenotypic effects in model systems, leveraging extensive molecular and phenotypic data and machine learning.
- Quant uniquely focuses on computing genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants under inheritance models, integrating these priors with observed/missing patient variant data using Bayesian statistics to provide posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis with uncertainty quantification.
- The patent does not disclose the specific modeling of false negative variant observations or the combinatorial Bayesian posterior calculation of diagnostic certainty across the genome.
- The patent’s domain and technical tools broadly overlap with genetic variant interpretation but do not present an invention blocking Quant’s distinct methodology and diagnostic focus.

Therefore, the patent does not block Quant’s freedom to operate as it does not claim or teach the core innovative concept of Quant’s approach.
