- **Publication No.:** WO2025029629A2

#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Genome sequencing identified a new gene associated with a cardiac arrhythmic disease, TAXI -binding protein 3. ... it was found that a specific molecule, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), is up-regulated and is associated with calcium mediated arrhythmic depolarizations."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent describes methods and compositions for inhibiting TRPV4 in cardiac tissue to reduce calcium sparks, leaks, and waves that lead to arrhythmia.
- It covers genetic screening for mutations or deletions in TAX1BP3, and the identification of chronic upregulation of TRPV4 as markers for arrhythmic cardiomyopathy or related cardiac disorders.
- Use of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and knockout mouse models to investigate the pathophysiology and therapeutic effects of TRPV4 inhibition.
- Experimental evidence for TRPV4 inhibitors (e.g., HC-067047, GSK2193874, GSK2798745) reducing Ca2+ leaks and spontaneous Ca2+ release events.
- The focus is on the molecular and therapeutic intervention at the level of TRPV4 activity to treat or prevent arrhythmogenic cardiac disorders.

#### Key Differences

- This patent deals specifically with the discovery of the TAX1BP3 gene’s role in arrhythmic cardiomyopathy and the therapeutic targeting of TRPV4 channels to treat calcium leak and arrhythmias.
- The technology is focused on cardiac tissue, molecular targets (TRPV4) and interventions (small molecule inhibitors) rather than on variant probability assessment or diagnosis certainty estimation.
- The patent does not discuss nor claim any system or method to integrate prior probabilities of genetic variants, observations of variant presence or absence, or Bayesian posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis.
- There is no mention of allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium calculations, or integrating false negatives and observed variant data in a statistical framework for genome-wide variant pathogenicity probability or diagnostic confidence.
- The claims and description emphasize methods of treating cardiac disorders by TRPV4 inhibition and associated genetic screening—not computational quantification or probability modeling of genetic variants at a genome-wide scale.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
While this patent involves genetic findings related to a cardiac disorder and the molecular mechanism of calcium leak via TRPV4, it fundamentally differs from Quant’s innovation. Quant’s core novelty is a computational Bayesian framework that integrates prior probabilities of variants across the genome with patient-observed and missing variant data to provide quantitative posterior probabilities for complete genetic diagnoses. This patent is focused on molecular biology, gene identification, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic TRPV4 inhibition without addressing variant probability calculations, diagnosis confidence intervals, or genome-scale variant probability integration using TP, FP, FN concepts. There is no close technical overlap in methods or concepts relevant to Quant’s FTO scope.
