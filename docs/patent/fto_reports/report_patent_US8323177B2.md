- **Publication No.:** US8323177B2

#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Methods, compositions and kits for determining the developmental potential of one or more embryos or pluripotent cells and/or the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in one or more embryos or pluripotent cells are provided. These methods, compositions and kits find use in identifying embryos and oocytes in vitro that are most useful in treating infertility in humans."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and US8323177B2 relate to genome-wide or cell-wide biological diagnostics involving probabilistic or quantitative assessment approaches.
- The patent focuses on measuring **cellular parameters** such as durations of cytokinesis events, time intervals between mitoses, and gene expression profiles in embryos/stem cells.
- The patent describes a method for **predicting developmental potential of embryos** based on quantitative timing of mitosis and cytokinesis (e.g. first cytokinesis duration, timing between first and second mitosis), resembling Quant’s use of quantitative measurements related to true positives (TP) events.
- It employs **time-lapse imaging** combined with **gene expression profiling** to assess embryo viability, integrating several measured parameters to predict developmental outcome.
- The claimed method involves automatic quantification of parameters related to cell division timing and morphological events, with statistical characterization of normal ranges (mean ± SD) and credible intervals for embryo viability.
- The application includes **automated image analysis algorithms**, including particle filtering, image processing, and Bayesian-like probabilistic modeling for tracking embryonic cell divisions.
- The patent discloses the use of **sensitivity and specificity metrics** in assessing predictive parameters for embryo viability, thus quantifying confidence in the developmental potential similar in spirit to Quant’s quantification of false negatives/diagnostic certainty.
- Emphasizes the **integration of multiple parameters** measured over time (duration of cytokinesis, inter-mitosis intervals) to predict developmental outcomes, akin to Quant’s integration of multiple variant-level probabilities to produce a genome-wide posterior.
- The disclosed methods provide **credible intervals and probabilistic reports** indicating confidence in embryo developmental potential, which echoes Quant’s generation of Bayesian credible intervals for diagnosis certainty.
- The patent is primarily directed at embryo and stem cell developmental assessment through time-lapse imaging and RNA/protein expression profiling, rather than direct genome-wide variant pathogenicity probability modeling.
- Automated tracking and probabilistic modeling of cell shapes and divisions reflects a conceptual overlap in data integration and model-based inference.

#### Key Differences

- The patent’s focus is on **embryo/stem cell developmental potential** prediction via **morphological timing parameters and gene expression**, not on interpreting **genetic variant pathogenicity** or integrating variant-level prior probabilities genome-wide.
- Quant uniquely integrates **population-level variant allele frequencies, gene inheritance modes, and variant classification data** under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium into a Bayesian posterior probability of genetic diagnosis, considering false negatives; the patent does not address variant data, prior probabilities of pathogenic variants, or genetic diagnosis confidence.
- US8323177B2 does not discuss or claim any methods involving true/false positive rates of variant detection, nor Bayesian integration of variant pathogenicity priors with observed/missing variant calls.
- The patent centers on **time-lapse embryo imaging and gene expression**, with algorithms for cell tracking and morphological parameter extraction, whereas Quant applies **statistical genetics and Bayesian modeling** to sequence variant interpretation.
- The patent’s analysis focuses on **single cell/nuclei level physical and molecular developmental parameters**, not on summarizing pathogenic variant probabilities across a genome or a gene panel for clinical diagnosis.
- The patent’s Bayesian/probabilistic model relates to **particle filters for imaging analysis**, not to Bayesian disease variant probability integration or diagnostic posteriors.
- Quant is designed for **clinical genomics diagnostics and variant interpretation in genetic diseases**, whereas US8323177B2 targets **IVF embryo selection and stem cell development potential assessment**.
- Overlaps are conceptual in probabilistic measurement and confidence quantification but differ fundamentally in data type and biological application domain.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** Although both the patent and Quant apply quantitative, probabilistic assessments and time-dependent parameter measurement in biological contexts, the patent’s focus on embryo/stem cell developmental potential prediction using time-lapse morphology and gene expression is distinct from Quant’s unique core method of probabilistically integrating genome-wide prior variant pathogenicity probabilities with observed sequence data (including false negatives) to compute Bayesian posterior probabilities of a genetic diagnosis. The patent neither discloses nor claims any aspect of variant pathogenicity priors, integration of variant detection uncertainty, or genome-wide Bayesian diagnostic confidence that is central to Quant’s novel method.
