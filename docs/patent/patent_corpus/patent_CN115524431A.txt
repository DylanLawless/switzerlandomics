### Description

Description Translated from Chinese 一种PWS综合征的生物标志物及其应用和试剂盒与数据处理 方法A biomarker of PWS syndrome and its application, kit and data processing method 技术领域technical field 本发明属于生物标志物技术领域，具体涉及一种PWS综合征的生物标志物及其应用和试剂盒与数据处理方法。The invention belongs to the technical field of biomarkers, and in particular relates to a PWS syndrome biomarker and its application, kit and data processing method. 背景技术Background technique Prader-Willi综合征(Prader-Willi syndrome,PWS)，俗称小胖威利综合征，是一种由父源染色体15q11-q13区域基因功能缺陷引起的累及全身多系统异常的印记基因遗传病。其基因缺陷主要类型有父源染色体15q11-q13区域约5～6Mb片段缺失(60％～75％)、母源单亲二倍体(maternal uniparental disomy,mUPD,20％～30％)，即两条15号染色体片段均来源于母亲；印迹缺陷(imprinting center defect,ID,2％～5％)包括印迹中心微缺失或突变；还有极少数PWS患儿发生15号染色体平衡易位(<1％)。最近的流行病学研究估计，PWS患病率约为1/30 000～1/15 000，大多数病例为散发性，没有种族和性别差异。PWS的主要临床表现为：婴儿期肌张力低和吸吮无力，导致无法茁壮成长；随后在婴幼儿后期或儿童早期出现贪食、能量消耗减少和代谢率低，逐渐发展为肥胖、身材矮小、生长速度减慢，智力残疾以及行为问题，后者主要表现为情绪化、冲动、脾气暴躁、攻击性、抠抓皮肤等自伤行为以及偷食、囤食等异常摄食行为。中年期肥胖会导致阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停、2型糖尿病和其他代谢综合征。PWS患者还可能有骨密度低、甲状腺疾病、隐睾、性腺功能减退以及青春期延迟或停滞等表现。PWS对患者的健康和寿命造成严重影响，导致每年约3％的死亡率(大约是正常人群的3倍)。患者病态性肥胖及其相关并发症以及突出的认知和行为问题给患者个人、家庭及社会带来了巨大的医疗和经济负担。事实上，PWS作为人类最早发现的与基因组印迹相关的遗传性疾病，早期诊断和合理干预可以在极大程度上改善该病患儿的远期预后。因此，开展早期诊断对于PWS患儿的早期治疗、改善生活质量、延长预期寿命具有极重要的意义。Prader-Willi syndrome (Prader-Willi syndrome, PWS), commonly known as chubby-Willi syndrome, is an imprinted genetic disease involving multiple systemic abnormalities caused by gene function defects in the paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 region. The main types of gene defects are paternal chromosome 15q11-q13 region about 5 ~ 6Mb fragment deletion (60% ~ 75%), maternal uniparental disomy (mUPD, 20% ~ 30%), namely two Chromosome 15 fragments are all derived from the mother; imprinting center defect (ID, 2%-5%) includes microdeletion or mutation in the imprinting center; there are very few children with PWS who have balanced translocation of chromosome 15 (<1% ). Recent epidemiological studies estimate that the prevalence of PWS is about 1/30 000 to 1/15 000, and most cases are sporadic, with no racial and gender differences. The main clinical manifestations of PWS are: hypotonia and sucking weakness in infancy, leading to failure to thrive, followed by bulimia, decreased energy expenditure and low metabolic rate in late infancy or early childhood, and gradually progressing to obesity, short stature, growth Slow speed, intellectual disability and behavioral problems, the latter mainly manifested as emotional, impulsive, short-tempered, aggressive, skin-picking and other self-injurious behaviors, as well as abnormal feeding behaviors such as stealing and hoarding food. Obesity in midlife leads to obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes and other metabolic syndromes. Patients with PWS may also have low bone mineral density, thyroid disease, cryptorchidism, hypogonadism, and delayed or arrested puberty. PWS has a serious impact on the health and life expectancy of patients, resulting in an annual mortality rate of about 3% (about three times that of the normal population). Morbid obesity and its associated complications, as well as prominent cognitive and behavioral problems, have brought huge medical and economic burdens to patients, their families, and society. In fact, PWS is the first genetic disease associated with genome imprinting discovered in humans. Early diagnosis and reasonable intervention can greatly improve the long-term prognosis of children with this disease. Therefore, early diagnosis is of great significance for early treatment, improvement of quality of life and life expectancy of children with PWS. Holm等于1993年首次提出了基于临床症状为特征的PWS临床评分诊断系统，该系统按年龄阶段，将每项临床表现按分数细化后汇总，实现了PWS的临床标准化诊断。但由于PWS患儿临床表现复杂多样，缺乏特异性，且受年龄、基因、种族等多种因素影响，仅凭临床诊断标准易造成漏诊、误诊，尤其是在新生儿时期因为严重的肌张力低下和喂养困难得以识别。此外，生长激素等生化指标也被用于辅助诊断，但是均不能达到非常有效的早期诊断和鉴别诊断。In 1993, Holm et al first proposed a PWS clinical scoring diagnostic system based on clinical symptoms. The system subdivided each clinical manifestation by score according to age and then summarized it, realizing the clinical standardized diagnosis of PWS. However, because the clinical manifestations of PWS children are complex and diverse, lack of specificity, and are affected by various factors such as age, gene, race, etc., it is easy to cause missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis based on clinical diagnostic criteria, especially in the neonatal period because of severe hypotonia and feeding difficulties are identified. In addition, biochemical indicators such as growth hormone are also used for auxiliary diagnosis, but none of them can achieve very effective early diagnosis and differential diagnosis. 随着人们对该病认识的加深和分子遗传学检测技术的飞速发展，为该病的确诊和遗传分型提供了有力的技术支持。如今基于临床症状为特征的PWS临床评分诊断系统的作用多趋于识别出可疑病例，以便进一步行分子遗传学检测确诊。目前最主要的分子遗传学检测手段包括：荧光原位杂交(FISH)技术，即利用标记的荧光探针检测染色体15q11-q13区域的缺失和重复，是较为成熟和应用比较广泛的检测手段。DNA甲基化分析技术，包括甲基化特异性多重连接依赖性探针扩增(methylation-specific multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification,MS-MLPA)和甲基化特异性聚合酶链式反应(methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction,MS-PCR)，其对PWS的诊断精确度可以达到99％，但却无法进一步区分具体的基因亚型，该方法直到九十年代中后期才逐渐为大家所认识、接受并应用；单核苷酸多态性微阵列芯片(SNP-arrays)分析的优势在于除了检测染色体拷贝数变异(CNV)以外，还可以检测出较长的连续性纯合区域(ROH)，因此对于UPD的诊断具有重要意义。上述每种方法均有其优缺点，例如：据统计，甲基化PCR可以检测约95％的PWS患儿，但该方法有两个明显缺陷：一是琼脂糖电泳分辨率低，结果可重复性相对较差，经常需要复查或者其他方法验证；二是手工操作繁琐，效率低下。除此之外，其相对高昂的检测费用也给患者带来较大的经济负担。目前公认的基因诊断策略为逐级鉴别。美国儿科学会针对PWS的健康管理指南推荐首先通过甲基化分析确立PWS的诊断，随后采用染色体核型分析和FISH技术诊断染色体15q11-q13的缺失或平衡易位；对于母源性UPD的诊断建议采用微卫星连锁分析结合分子遗传学检测的手段。即甲基化PCR为一线手段，MLPA和CMA等手段为二线技术，基因测序为最后手段。PWS的诊断在产前即可以作出，但常规的产前染色体检查并不能覆盖该病。对于已经出生过PWS患儿的家庭，确定该患儿的遗传缺陷类型对于后续的遗传咨询和再发风险分析至关重要。临床医师若能及早发现患儿的异常体征并结合基因检测将有助于疾病的及时确诊，进而积极给予临床干预及家庭护理，可推迟并发症的发生，从而有助于改善患儿的预后。With the deepening of people's understanding of the disease and the rapid development of molecular genetic testing technology, it provides strong technical support for the diagnosis and genetic typing of the disease. Today's PWS clinical score diagnostic system based on clinical symptoms tends to identify suspicious cases for further molecular genetic testing. At present, the most important molecular genetic detection methods include: fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technology, which uses labeled fluorescent probes to detect deletions and duplications in the chromosome 15q11-q13 region, which is a relatively mature and widely used detection method. DNA methylation analysis techniques, including methylation-specific multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (methylation-specific multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification, MS-MLPA) and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (methylation-specific specific polymerase chain reaction, MS-PCR), its diagnostic accuracy for PWS can reach 99%, but it cannot further distinguish specific gene subtypes. Application; The advantage of single nucleotide polymorphism microarray chip (SNP-arrays) analysis is that in addition to detecting chromosomal copy number variation (CNV), it can also detect a long continuous region of homozygosity (ROH), so for The diagnosis of UPD is of great significance. Each of the above methods has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, according to statistics, methylation PCR can detect about 95% of children with PWS, but this method has two obvious defects: one is the low resolution of agarose electrophoresis, and the results are reproducible The reliability is relatively poor, and often needs to be checked or verified by other methods; the second is that the manual operation is cumbersome and inefficient. In addition, its relatively high testing costs also bring a greater financial burden to patients. The currently recognized genetic diagnosis strategy is step-by-step identification. The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for the health management of PWS recommend that the diagnosis of PWS be first established by methylation analysis, followed by karyotype analysis and FISH techniques to diagnose deletions or balanced translocations of chromosome 15q11-q13; recommendations for the diagnosis of maternal UPD Microsatellite linkage analysis combined with molecular genetic testing was used. That is, methylation PCR is the first-line method, MLPA and CMA are the second-line techniques, and gene sequencing is the last resort. The diagnosis of PWS can be made prenatally, but the routine prenatal chromosome examination cannot cover the disease. For families who have had a child with PWS, determining the genetic defect type of the child is crucial for subsequent genetic counseling and recurrence risk analysis. If clinicians can detect the abnormal signs of children early and combine with genetic testing, it will help to diagnose the disease in time, and then actively provide clinical intervention and family care, which can delay the occurrence of complications and help improve the prognosis of children. 代谢组学是继基因组学和蛋白质组学之后发展起来的一门系统生物学学科，可用于研究生物体在内在或者外在因素影响后其内源性代谢物种类、数量及变化规律。尽管单个平台不能分析检测出所有的代谢物，但通过对不同表型有机体的整个代谢谱进行分析，探寻代谢物与生理病理变化之间的对应关系，能为疾病诊断提供依据。代谢组学初期的研究以NMR为主要分析工具，随着高效快速的HPLC/MS技术的出现，将其应用于代谢组学方面研究的报道越来越多，如：Plumb等用LC-MS筛选老鼠尿液中药物代谢标志物；Lafaye等用HPLC-MS分析重金属在老鼠体内的毒性反应。Metabolomics is a discipline of systems biology developed after genomics and proteomics. It can be used to study the types, quantities and changes of endogenous metabolites in organisms under the influence of internal or external factors. Although a single platform cannot analyze and detect all metabolites, by analyzing the entire metabolic spectrum of organisms with different phenotypes and exploring the correspondence between metabolites and physiological and pathological changes, it can provide a basis for disease diagnosis. The initial research on metabolomics used NMR as the main analysis tool. With the emergence of efficient and fast HPLC/MS technology, there are more and more reports on its application in metabolomics research, such as: Plumb et al. use LC-MS to screen Drug metabolism markers in mouse urine; Lafaye et al. used HPLC-MS to analyze the toxicity of heavy metals in mice. 脂质是生命过程中必不可少的一类物质，在物质运输、能量转换、信息识别与传递、细胞分化及凋亡等方面发挥了重要作用。脂肪酸、甘油三酯、磷脂、胆固醇等脂质代谢紊乱是肥胖发生的重要内源性因素，与肥胖的发生发展密切相关。近年来，脂质组学(Lipidomics)技术的不断发展为深入了解脂质代谢紊乱提供了重要工具。通过系统分析不同群体脂质及代谢物中的全部脂质，以及各种刺激或干预对脂质的影响，可从系统整体水平上探究脂质代谢相关疾病的发生机制。目前，基于脂质代谢组学筛选肥胖症标志物的研究虽已有相关报道，但对于PWS综合症这一特殊肥胖人群，其与普通代谢性肥胖相比，其特征性脂质生物标记物信息尚不明确。因此，筛选与PWS综合症相关的脂质代谢标志物，特别是多个代谢标志物的联合使用，对PWS综合症临床诊断和治疗具有重大意义。Lipid is an essential class of substances in the process of life, and plays an important role in material transportation, energy conversion, information recognition and transmission, cell differentiation and apoptosis. Lipid metabolism disorders such as fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol are important endogenous factors for the occurrence of obesity, and are closely related to the occurrence and development of obesity. In recent years, the continuous development of lipidomics technology has provided an important tool for in-depth understanding of lipid metabolism disorders. By systematically analyzing all lipids in different groups of lipids and metabolites, and the effects of various stimuli or interventions on lipids, the mechanism of lipid metabolism-related diseases can be explored at the overall system level. At present, although studies on the screening of obesity markers based on lipid metabolomics have been reported, for the special obese population of PWS syndrome, compared with ordinary metabolic obesity, the information of characteristic lipid biomarkers still uncertain. Therefore, screening lipid metabolism markers related to PWS syndrome, especially the combined use of multiple metabolic markers, is of great significance for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PWS syndrome. 发明内容Contents of the invention 为了克服现有技术的不足，本发明的目的之一在于提供一种PWS综合征的生物标志物，可用于PWS综合征的临床早期筛查、诊断、患病风险评估，具有较好的PWS综合征判别准确度。In order to overcome the deficiencies of the prior art, one of the objectives of the present invention is to provide a biomarker for PWS syndrome, which can be used for early clinical screening, diagnosis, and disease risk assessment of PWS syndrome, and has a better PWS comprehensive Levy discrimination accuracy. 本发明的目的之二在于提供一种生物标志物在PWS综合征的患病风险评估或早期诊断的试剂中的应用。The second object of the present invention is to provide the application of a biomarker in the risk assessment or early diagnosis of PWS syndrome. 本发明的目的之三在于提供一种PWS综合征的检测试剂盒，可快速、低成本检测PWS综合症患者，适用于大规模应用。The third object of the present invention is to provide a detection kit for PWS syndrome, which can detect PWS syndrome patients quickly and at low cost, and is suitable for large-scale application. 本发明的目的之四在于提供一种用于PWS综合征患病风险评估的数据处理方法，用于预测PWS综合征患病风险概率，准确度高。The fourth object of the present invention is to provide a data processing method for PWS syndrome risk assessment, which is used to predict the PWS syndrome risk probability with high accuracy. 本发明的目的之一采用如下技术方案实现：One of purpose of the present invention adopts following technical scheme to realize: 一种PWS综合征的生物标志物，包括FFA(22:6)(游离脂肪酸)和LPE(20:1)(溶血磷脂酰乙醇胺)。A biomarker of PWS syndrome including FFA (22:6) (free fatty acids) and LPE (20:1) (lysophosphatidylethanolamine). 进一步地，还包括20:4(FFA)，P18:0(LPE)和D18:0-22:4(PC)中的至少一种。Further, at least one of 20:4 (FFA), P18:0 (LPE) and D18:0-22:4 (PC) is also included. 进一步地，所述生物标志物的提取方法，包括以下步骤：Further, the extraction method of the biomarker comprises the following steps: S1，取氯仿和甲醇按照体积比1:0.7-1.5混合均匀，加入血清样本液，得到血清处理液；S1, take chloroform and methanol according to the volume ratio of 1:0.7-1.5 and mix evenly, add serum sample solution to obtain serum treatment solution;

Logistic modeling 整理测试数据，为3个实验组设置分类标记：Normal–0；PWS–1；SO–0.5。以上述实施例2中的5个候选变量构建多分类Logistic回归模型，通过逐步回归选择关键变量，经逐步回归得到模型关键变量为R1:22:6(FFA)；R4:20:1(LPE)。Organize test data and set classification marks for 3 experimental groups: Normal–0; PWS–1; SO–0.5. With 5 candidate variables in the above-mentioned embodiment 2, construct multi-classification Logistic regression model, select key variable by stepwise regression, obtain model key variable through stepwise regression and be R1:22:6 (FFA); R4:20:1 (LPE) . 使用5个候选变量建立初步模型后，采用R语言(版本号4.1.0)中的step()函数对上述变量进行筛选并得到逐步回归后的模型(逐步回归可以很好降低模型维度，降低逻辑回归模型多重共线性)。该函数基于AIC值对候选变量进行评价，从而选择对模型具有实际重要意义的变量，一方面可以降低模型的复杂程度，另一方面也可以减少模型在使用时所需收集的数据。After using 5 candidate variables to establish a preliminary model, use the step() function in R language (version number 4.1.0) to screen the above variables and obtain the model after stepwise regression (stepwise regression can reduce the dimension of the model very well and reduce the logic Regression model multicollinearity). This function evaluates the candidate variables based on the AIC value, so as to select variables with practical significance to the model. On the one hand, it can reduce the complexity of the model, and on the other hand, it can also reduce the data that needs to be collected when the model is used. 所得判别公式系数如下：The obtained discriminant formula coefficients are as follows: coefficients：coefficients: 依据多分类Logistic模型原理可得:According to the principle of multi-classification Logistic model, we can get: 又有P(Normal)+P(PWS)+P(SO)＝1And P(Normal)+P(PWS)+P(SO)=1 设：Assume: B＝2.006541-35.79531×R1-2.99449×R41C＝5.740151-25.59479×R1-7.648766×R4B＝2.006541-35.79531×R1-2.99449×R4 1 C＝5.740151-25.59479×R1-7.648766×R4 则：but: 其中，R1为FFA(22：6)的含量；R4为LPE(20：1)的含量；P(PWS)为PWS综合征的患病概率；P(SO)为普通肥胖的患病概率；P(Normal)为正常的发生概率。Among them, R1 is the content of FFA (22:6); R4 is the content of LPE (20:1); P(PWS) is the prevalence probability of PWS syndrome; P(SO) is the prevalence probability of ordinary obesity; P (Normal) is the normal probability of occurrence. 由上述公式即可计算出各组别的概率，从而判定是否患病。The probability of each group can be calculated by the above formula, so as to determine whether it is sick or not. 2.1计算模型在测试数据集中的预测准确度2.1 Calculate the prediction accuracy of the model in the test data set 使用R语言(版本号4.1.0)中的predict()函数，利用所建立模型对测试数据进行预测。预测准确度数据为使用sample()函数随机抽样所得。使用所得模型对测试数据集进行预测，预测准确度为：Use the predict() function in the R language (version number 4.1.0) to predict the test data using the established model. The prediction accuracy data is randomly sampled using the sample() function.

The prediction accuracy was: Normal：87.5％，PWS：87.5％，SO：75％。Normal: 87.5%, PWS: 87.5%, SO: 75%. 上述证明本发明的一种PWS综合征的生物标志物，具有较好的PWS综合征判别准确度(准确度大于80％)，可应用在PWS综合征的患病风险评估或早期诊断的试剂中。因此本发明也可采集受试者样本中生物标志物的含量，根据所述Logistic模型中，计算得到PWS综合征的患病风险概率。The above proves that a PWS syndrome biomarker of the present invention has good PWS syndrome discrimination accuracy (accuracy greater than 80%), and can be used in the reagents for the risk assessment or early diagnosis of PWS syndrome .
