#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure provides a method for genetic analysis for disease diagnoses, as well as a system for implementing such analysis... The invention provides Genome-to-Treatment (GTRxSM), which is an automated, virtual system for genetic disease diagnosis and acute management guidance."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent describes a method for automated genetic disease diagnosis integrating:
  - Extraction of clinical phenotypes from electronic medical records (EMR) using clinical natural language processing (CNLP).
  - Translation of clinical phenotypes into standardized vocabularies (e.g., Human Phenotype Ontology).
  - Generation of ranked lists of potential differential diagnoses by combining phenotypic data and genetic variant information derived from genome sequencing (including rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS) and whole exome sequencing).
  - Annotation and classification of genetic variants with respect to pathogenicity status (pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS).
  - Use of Bayesian and machine learning models (MOON™, GEM™, Illumina TruSight™) for variant ranking and provisional diagnosis generation.
  - Integration of phenotype and genotype data to prioritize genetic diseases.
  - Automation of the entire pipeline from sequencing to provisional diagnosis reporting.
  - Provision of treatment guidance linked to provisional diagnoses via a curated, expert-reviewed information resource (GTRxSM), including treatment efficacy, evidence quality, contraindications, and timing.
  - Automated or assisted generation of reports for clinical decision-making.
- The invention explicitly accounts for:
  - Inheritance modes (dominant, recessive, X-linked).
  - Integration of clinical phenotype data extracted by CNLP with genomic variant data.
  - Variant pathogenicity annotation referencing population allele frequencies and clinical databases (ClinVar, gnomAD).
- The method includes probabilistic ranking of differential diagnoses based on phenotype-genotype fit but does not emphasize modeling of observing (prior) probabilities genome-wide or specifically calculating posterior probabilities of genetic diagnosis including false negative (unobserved variant) probabilities.
- The claims focus on generating ranked lists of potential diagnoses and treatment options from combined phenotype and genotype data, using natural language processing, sequencing, and variant annotation.

#### Key Differences

- Quant’s core novelty is the integration of genome-wide **prior probabilities** of pathogenic variants with observed patient variant calls and explicit modelling of false negatives (missing variants), yielding a **Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis**, along with credible intervals quantifying diagnostic confidence.

- The patent focuses on ranking potential diagnoses by phenotypic and genotypic matching and providing treatment guidance, but does **not disclose a mathematical framework that computes prior expectations of pathogenic variant observations under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium across all genes nor an explicit incorporation of false negative probabilities of variant observation**.

- Although Bayesian models are mentioned (MOON™ uses Bayesian models for variant pathogenicity scoring), these serve for variant ranking in isolation rather than providing a posterior probability statement integrating prior genome-wide pathogenic variant expectations with the patient-specific variant observation or non-observation.

- The patent’s system does not appear to model diagnostic certainty as a credible interval or confidence metric that quantifies uncertainty in diagnosis due to unobserved variants; instead, it produces ranked differential diagnosis lists and associated treatment plans.

- The patent’s novelty emphasizes rapid, scalable diagnosis incorporating phenome extraction, genetic variant identification, and treatment recommendation rather than an integrated probabilistic framework of genome-wide penetrance and observation modeling.

- Use of TP, FN, TN, FP or formal probabilistic modeling of detection sensitivity or missing data (false negative variant calls) in the context of genome interpretation and diagnostic confidence is not described.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** While EP4352731A1 discloses an automated pipeline integrating CNLP-derived phenotype extraction, genome sequencing variant analysis, variant pathogenicity annotation, and ranked provisional diagnoses with linked treatment guidance, it does not disclose nor claim the probabilistic theory and methods unique to Quant — specifically, the genome-wide prior probability modeling of pathogenic variant occurrence, explicit consideration of false negative (unobserved variant) probabilities, and computation of Bayesian posterior probabilities with credible intervals reflecting diagnostic certainty.

The Bayesian methods in the patent are limited to variant pathogenicity ranking within gene-phenotype associations and do not extend to Quant’s innovation of probabilistic quantification of confidence in the completeness of a genetic diagnosis at the genome or gene level.

Therefore, there is no close technical overlap that would block freedom-to-operate for Quant based on the theory or method claims herein.
