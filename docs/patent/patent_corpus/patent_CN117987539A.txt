### Description

Description Translated from Chinese 用于检测ABCG8突变基因的试剂在制备用于检测谷固醇血症1 型患者或携带者的试剂盒中的应用Use of a reagent for detecting ABCG8 mutant gene in preparing a kit for detecting sitosterolemia type 1 patients or carriers 技术领域Technical Field 本发明涉及ABCG8突变基因检测领域，具体而言，涉及一种用于检测ABCG8突变基因的试剂在制备用于检测谷固醇血症1型患者或携带者的试剂盒中的应用。The present invention relates to the field of ABCG8 mutant gene detection, and in particular to an application of a reagent for detecting ABCG8 mutant gene in preparing a kit for detecting sitosterolemia type 1 patients or carriers. 背景技术Background technique 谷甾醇血症，也称为植物甾醇血症，是一种常染色体隐性代谢疾病，其特征是肠道对胆固醇和植物衍生的胆固醇样分子（如谷甾醇）的吸收不受限制。患有这种疾病的患者血浆中植物甾醇水平非常高，并会出现肌腱和结节性黄瘤、加速动脉粥样硬化和过早冠状动脉疾病。Sitosterolemia, also known as phytosterolemia, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by unrestricted intestinal absorption of cholesterol and plant-derived cholesterol-like molecules such as sitosterol. Patients with this disorder have very high plasma levels of phytosterols and develop tendinous and tuberous xanthomas, accelerated atherosclerosis, and premature coronary artery disease. 谷固醇血症1型，由ABCG8基因突变引起，ABCG8位于常染色体2p21，基因全长约28kb，包含13个外显子和12个内含子，编码6732个氨基酸，ABCG8蛋白含有N端ATP结合基序和ABC转运蛋白特征基序，并且预计两者的C端均含有6个跨膜片段。两者在肝脏中高度表达，并且在小肠和结肠中也可检测到。胆固醇喂养诱导小鼠中ABCG8 mRNA水平的协调增加。ABCG8通常合作限制肠道吸收并促进甾醇的胆汁排泄，并且这些转运蛋白的突变形式容易导致甾醇积累和动脉粥样硬化。Sitosterolemia type 1 is caused by mutations in the ABCG8 gene. ABCG8 is located on autosome 2p21. The gene is approximately 28 kb long, contains 13 exons and 12 introns, and encodes 6732 amino acids. The ABCG8 protein contains an N-terminal ATP binding motif and an ABC transporter characteristic motif, and both are predicted to contain 6 transmembrane segments at the C-terminus. Both are highly expressed in the liver and can also be detected in the small intestine and colon. Cholesterol feeding induces a coordinated increase in ABCG8 mRNA levels in mice. ABCG8 normally cooperates to limit intestinal absorption and promote biliary excretion of sterols, and mutant forms of these transporters are prone to sterol accumulation and atherosclerosis. 基因突变是导致谷甾醇血症1型发生发展的重要遗传基础，基因诊断是确诊谷固醇血症1型的金标准，临床上需要针对不同突变建立相应的检测技术并用于明确病因和疾病诊断，但现有技术中对于能够导致谷甾醇血症1型的突变类型知晓的仍不全面，难以满足临床需求。Gene mutation is an important genetic basis for the occurrence and development of sitosterolemia type 1.

However, the existing technology still does not fully understand the types of mutations that can cause sitosterolemia type 1, which is difficult to meet clinical needs. 发明内容Summary of the invention 本发明的主要目的在于提供一种用于检测ABCG8突变基因的试剂在制备用于检测谷固醇血症1型患者或携带者的试剂盒中的应用，以解决现有技术中对于谷甾醇血症1型的检测不能满足临床需求的问题。The main purpose of the present invention is to provide a reagent for detecting ABCG8 mutant gene for use in the preparation of a kit for detecting sitosterolemia type 1 patients or carriers, so as to solve the problem that the detection of sitosterolemia type 1 in the prior art cannot meet clinical needs. 为了实现上述目的，根据本发明的第一个方面，提供了一种用于检测ABCG8突变基因的试剂在制备用于检测谷固醇血症1型患者或携带者的试剂盒中的应用，上述ABCG8突变基因包括c.892C>T和/或c.490C>T。In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, according to the first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a reagent for detecting ABCG8 mutant gene for use in preparing a kit for detecting sitosterolemia type 1 patients or carriers, wherein the above-mentioned ABCG8 mutant gene includes c.892C>T and/or c.490C>T. 进一步地，试剂盒包括扩增c.892C>T和/或c.490C>T的引物。Further, the kit includes primers for amplifying c.892C>T and/or c.490C>T. 进一步地，扩增c.892C>T的引物包括第一上游引物和第一下游引物，第一上游引物的核苷酸序列如SEQ ID NO：1所示，第一下游引物的核苷酸序列如SEQ ID NO：2所示；优选地，扩增c.490C>T的引物包括第二上游引物和第二下游引物，第二上游引物的核苷酸序列如SEQ ID NO：3所示，第二下游引物的核苷酸序列如SEQ ID NO：4所示。Further, the primers for amplifying c.892C>T include a first upstream primer and a first downstream primer, the nucleotide sequence of the first upstream primer is shown in SEQ ID NO: 1, and the nucleotide sequence of the first downstream primer is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2;

The present invention will be described in detail below in conjunction with the embodiments. 如背景技术所提到的，谷固醇血症1型是一种常染色体隐性遗传的疾病，基因诊断是确诊的金标准，但ABCG8基因全长较长，且现有技术中对于能够导致谷甾醇血症1型的突变类型知晓的仍不全面，难以满足临床检测和诊断的需求。不是所有无义突变都会导致该疾病，需要同时满足复合杂合或纯合的遗传条件，同时该位点ACMG评级为致病/可能致病/或与临床相符合的vus（意义未明变异）位点，才可能导致谷固醇血症1型，因此在临床中对于该种疾病的诊断存在困难。在本申请中发明人尝试探究新的能够导致谷固醇血症1型的突变，在此基础上开发能够诊断或预测谷固醇血症1型的试剂盒和探针，因而提出了本申请的一系列保护方案。As mentioned in the background technology, sitosterolemia type 1 is an autosomal recessive disease, and genetic diagnosis is the gold standard for diagnosis, but the full length of the ABCG8 gene is relatively long, and the types of mutations that can cause sitosterolemia type 1 are still not fully known in the prior art, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of clinical detection and diagnosis. Not all nonsense mutations will cause the disease, and it is necessary to meet the genetic conditions of compound heterozygosity or homozygosity at the same time, and the site ACMG rating is pathogenic/possibly pathogenic/or clinically consistent with the vus (variant of unknown significance) site, which may cause sitosterolemia type 1, so there are difficulties in the diagnosis of this disease in the clinic. In this application, the inventors try to explore new mutations that can cause sitosterolemia type 1, and on this basis develop kits and probes that can diagnose or predict sitosterolemia type 1, and thus propose a series of protection schemes for this application. 在本申请第一种典型的实施方式中，提供了一种用于检测ABCG8突变基因的试剂在制备用于检测谷固醇血症1型患者或携带者的试剂盒中的应用，上述ABCG8突变基因包括c.892C>T和/或c.490C>T。野生型ABCG8基因的登录号为NM_022437.3。In a first typical embodiment of the present application, a reagent for detecting a mutant ABCG8 gene is provided for use in preparing a kit for detecting sitosterolemia type 1 patients or carriers, wherein the mutant ABCG8 gene includes c.892C>T and/or c.490C>T. The accession number of the wild-type ABCG8 gene is NM_022437.3. 在上述应用中，利用能够检测ABCG8突变基因的试剂制备试剂盒，利用此种试剂盒通过对ABCG8突变基因c.892C>T和/或c.490C>T进行检测，丰富了致病基因突变谱，从而实现对于谷固醇血症1型的诊断或预测。若检测结果为野生型ABCG8基因892位置C碱基突变为T碱基，此种无义突变的发生会导致ABCG8基因所编码的蛋白质第298位置氨基酸Gln发生终止，第298位置后续的氨基酸缺失（ABCG8:NM_022437.3:exon6:c.892C>T:p.Gln298*）。若检测结果为野生型ABCG8基因490位置C碱基突变为T碱基导致无义突变，ABCG8基因所编码的蛋白质第164位置氨基酸Arg发生终止，第164位置后续的氨基酸缺失（ABCG8:NM_022437.3:exon4:c.490C>T:p.Arg164*）。In the above application, a reagent capable of detecting ABCG8 mutant gene is used to prepare a kit, and the kit is used to detect ABCG8 mutant gene c.892C>T and/or c.490C>T, thereby enriching the pathogenic gene mutation spectrum, thereby achieving the diagnosis or prediction of sitosterolemia type 1. If the test result is that the C base at position 892 of the wild-type ABCG8 gene mutates to the T base, the occurrence of this nonsense mutation will cause the amino acid Gln at position 298 of the protein encoded by the ABCG8 gene to terminate, and the subsequent amino acids at position 298 are missing (ABCG8:NM_022437.3:exon6:c.892C>T:p.Gln298*). If the test result is that the C base at position 490 of the wild-type ABCG8 gene mutates to the T base, resulting in a nonsense mutation, the amino acid Arg at position 164 of the protein encoded by the ABCG8 gene terminates, and the subsequent amino acids at position 164 are missing (ABCG8:NM_022437.3:exon4:c.490C>T:p.Arg164*). 谷固醇血症1型是一种常染色体隐性遗传的疾病，若受试者的一对同源染色体上的ABCG8基因均发生致病突变，两条染色体上的致病突变可以相同也可以不同，会导致谷固醇血症1型疾病。上述试剂盒中含有能够检测ABCG8突变基因c.892C>T和/或c.490C>T的试剂， c.892C>T和/或c.490C>T能够作为诊断谷固醇血症1型的生物标志物，通过检测受试者是否携带该变异，用于谷固醇血症1型的遗传学诊断、筛查和优生优育指导。Sitosterolemia type 1 is an autosomal recessive disease.
