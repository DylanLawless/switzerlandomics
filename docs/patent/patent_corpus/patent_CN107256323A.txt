### Description

Description Construction method and construction system of type II diabetes risk assessment modelTechnical Field The invention belongs to the field of genetic risk assessment of polygenic diseases, relates to a construction method and a construction system of a II type diabetes risk assessment model, and particularly relates to a method and a system of a polygenic disease risk assessment model constructed based on a Bayesian algorithm and epidemiological morbidity. Background In the population suffering from diabetes in China, the type II diabetes accounts for more than 90.0 percent, the type 1 diabetes accounts for about 5.0 percent, the prevalence rate of urban gestational diabetes is close to 5.0 percent, and the prevalence rate of other types of diabetes only accounts for about 0.7 percent. Table 1 shows the characteristics, symptoms and complications of type ii diabetes: TABLE 1 characteristics, symptoms and complications of type II diabetes The main symptoms of type ii diabetes are hyperglycemia, varying degrees of insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretory function. Type ii diabetes causes various life inconveniences to the patient, such as thirst, weakness, impaired vision, etc. Excessive blood glucose concentration in blood can cause damage to blood vessels and organs, cause various complications and cause great pain to patients. The causes of the disease include environmental factors, lifestyle factors, age factors, and genetic factors. In recent years, various genes have been found to be associated with type II diabetes. These findings provide a possibility for predicting disease risk based on personal genome sequencing. Currently, the general flow of disease risk prediction based on second generation sequencing is as follows: firstly, establishing a relationship between genes and disease risks aiming at specific diseases; secondly, establishing a disease risk assessment model aiming at the risk gene information of the disease; and finally, inputting the individual gene sequence information into a disease risk assessment model to obtain the disease risk. Therefore, two key points in disease risk prediction are establishing gene-disease relationships and disease risk assessment models. Common databases of human diseases include OMIM, HGMD, GWAS, and the like. Although these databases collect a large number of disease-related genes, these information are diverse in source, contain a large amount of noise, cannot be directly used for disease risk prediction, and require rigorous filtering. The filtration means commonly used are as follows: p value, OR value, frequency, sample size, linkage disequilibrium, and the like. All of these filtering means ensure the ability of the disease risk genes to indicate disease risk. After the disease risk genes are determined, a disease risk prediction model needs to be established. Generally, a disease risk prediction model is a functional relationship between the disease risk genes that have been selected and the disease state. Currently, there are 2 algorithms for the prediction of disease risk: simple GRS and weighted GRS. (1) Simple GRS: GRS ═ Σ Si (Si is the number of corresponding SNPs). The algorithm considers each risk allele to act equally, calculated only on the number of relevant risk alleles. Lv D et al in 'Genetic variationsin SEC16B, MC4R, MAP2K5and KCTD15 ee associated with a child organism and transformed with a di etIn the article 'GRS for obesity calculation,' homozygote for high risk allele (two high risk alleles) was designated as 2, heterozygote as 1, and homozygote for low risk allele as 0 (2) weighted GRS: ∑βiThe algorithm considers that each risk allele has different influence on the disease, and each risk allele is endowed with a corresponding weight to show that different SNPs have different influence on the disease, the weight is usually the natural logarithm of the odds ratio of the SNPs, and is usually obtained by taking the logarithm of the odds ratio in GWAS research or by regression coefficients β in a related regression model. Disclosure of Invention The invention aims to overcome the defects in the prior art, provides a novel construction method of a II type diabetes risk assessment model, solves the problems in the common risk assessment model to the greatest extent, enables the risk of II type diabetes to be closer to the real condition, and has more scientific and reasonable results. The invention is realized by the following technical scheme: a method for constructing a type II diabetes risk assessment model comprises the following steps: (1) acquiring SNP sites associated with type II diabetes; (2) calculating the risk degree (OR value) of the SNP locus associated with the type II diabetes in east Asia population, and obtaining the SNP locus with the OR value being more than OR equal to 1.08; (3) calculating the frequency value of all risk alleles of the SNP loci with the OR value of more than OR equal to 1.08 in east Asian population (namely normal population) without acquiring type II diabetes, and acquiring the SNP loci with the frequency value of more than OR equal to 0.01 as the filtered SNP loci; (4) calculating the number of risk alleles of all filtered SNPs in a Chinese individual (namely, one individual in the Chinese population); (5) calculating the epidemiological prevalence of type II diabetes of Chinese population; (6) and constructing a risk evaluation model of the Chinese individual according to a Bayesian algorithm and a Hardy-Winberg balance principle. Wherein, in the step (1), the acquisition of the SNP locus associated with the type II diabetes mellitus comprises the following steps: step 1-1: obtaining SNP sites (namely T2D Consortium sites) associated with type II diabetes from a T2D-GENES Consortium database, a GoT2D Consortium database and a DIAGRAMConsortium database, wherein the study population is east Asian population (namely Chinese, Japan, Korea and Singapore Hieran); obtaining SNP sites (GWAS sites) related to type II diabetes from GWAS (Genome-wide association study) research literature, wherein the significance level is 0.000001, and the research population is east Asian population; SNP loci (Candidate gene loci) related to type II diabetes mellitus are obtained from a literature database of Candidate gene (Candidate gene) research, wherein the significance level is 0.05, and the research population is east Asian population. Step 1-2: combining the T2D Consortium locus, GWAS locus and candidate gene locus together, removing repeated locus, and performing linkageAnalysis, preservation of linkage disequilibrium (linkage disequilibrium) r2Value (correlationcoefficient)<The SNP site of 0.8 is taken as the SNP site associated with the type II diabetes. In step (2), the risk of the SNP site, i.e., the OR value (Odds ratio), is calculated by: acquiring an OR value of type II diabetes associated SNP sites in a literature database researched by GWAS and a literature database researched by candidate genes in east Asia population; or, and combining sample data information of east Asian population, and calculating the OR value of the type II diabetes associated SNP site in east Asian population by a four-table method of case-control research. In step (3), the frequency value is calculated by: adopting the frequency value of the risk allele of the SNP locus with the OR value of more than OR equal to 1.08 in the literature database researched by GWAS and the literature data researched by candidate genes in the east Asian population without acquiring the type II diabetes; or, and combining sample data information of the east Asian population, and calculating the frequency value of the risk allele of the SNP locus with the OR value of more than OR equal to 1.08 in the east Asian population without acquiring the type II diabetes. The SNP sites obtained by the above steps after filtration are: rs10229583, rs10811661, rs10886471, rs10906115, rs10993738, rs1111875, rs11257655, rs11787792, rs12010175, rs13266634, rs1327796, rs1359790, rs1436953, rs1436955, rs1470579, rs1535500, rs163182, rs17584499, rs1801282, rs2028299, rs2237892, rs2237895, rs2237897, rs312457, rs 3797, rs391300, rs4430796, rs4712524, rs5219, rs5945326, rs6467136, rs6780569, rs7041847, rs7656416, rs7756992, rs7903146 and rs 791595. In step (4), the number of risk alleles of all filtered SNPs in chinese individuals was calculated as: each SNP is a genotype consisting of 2 alleles, and the genotype of each SNP consists of 3 cases according to free combination: regarding an SNP containing 2 normal alleles as the number of risk alleles of the SNP is 0; regarding a SNP containing 1 normal allele as the number of risk alleles of the SNP of 1; an SNP containing 0 normal alleles is considered as the number of risk alleles of the SNP to be 2. The normal allele is an allele which does not cause an increased risk of developing the disease (type II diabetes) and the risk allele is an allele which causes an increased risk of developing the disease. In step (5), the epidemiological prevalence of type ii diabetes is calculated by: acquiring the epidemiological prevalence rate of type II diabetes in Chinese population from a database of the health counseling organization or a database of the world health organization; or, the epidemiological prevalence of type ii diabetes in the chinese population was calculated from the literature of the GWAS study and the literature of the candidate gene study and was 10.44%.

The prevalence rate r of type ii diabetes was 10.44%, and the OR values and frequency values of all SNP sites were substituted into the formula, and the calculation results are shown in table 2: TABLE 2 type II diabetes Risk level and population proportion Risk rating Percentage of population Normalized OR value lower bound Upper normalized OR value Lower limit of risk of disease Upper limit of risk of disease Is low in 21.10％ 0 0.657 0.00％ 6.86％ In 73.30％ 0.657 1.598 6.86％ 16.68％ Is higher than 4.40％ 1.598 2.602 16.68％ 27.16％ Height of 1.20％ 2.602 Inf 27.16％ Inf As can be seen from Table 2, the model of the invention can accurately calculate the population distribution and the prevalence of four risk levels, and provide a solid scientific support for the population screening and the individual prevention of type II diabetes.
