#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Techniques are described for estimating selection coefficients (700) for missense mutations (500) and PTVs (504). In certain embodiments, such estimates may be based on forward-time population modeling and/or deep learning to facilitate estimation of individual-level selection burdens (704) and/or to identify individuals with increased (or decreased) genetic risk of reduced fitness (712) (including lifespan (812) and/or fecundity (912) metrics) relative to a threshold (720), such as a statistically mean or median fitness, lifespan, or fecundity based on a subject's demographic data."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of estimated selection coefficients for missense and protein truncating variants (PTVs) based on population genetic modeling.
- Calculation of an individual-level selection burden by aggregating variant-level selection coefficients.
- Quantification of fitness, lifespan, and fecundity metrics as numerical measures derived from variant burdens in individuals.
- Application of Cox proportional hazards regression and survival analysis for lifespan prediction.
- Use of gene panel data to calculate selection burden limited to gene subsets relevant to a disease or condition.
- Incorporation of a multiplicative model of variant effects on fitness or survival.
- Presentation of clinical or financial action options based on the estimated burden or metrics.
- Estimation of credible metrics for diagnosis or prognosis related to genetic variation impacts.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on estimating *selection coefficients* and *selection burden* as fitness metrics and their association with lifespan, fecundity, and clinical outcomes, but it does **not** describe calculating or integrating *prior probabilities* for disease-causing variants under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium across the genome.
- Does not explicitly model or integrate *observed* true positives (TP) and *unobserved* false negatives (FN) to compute a Bayesian posterior probability of a *complete genetic diagnosis*.
- No mention or teaching of deriving credible intervals that quantify *diagnostic certainty* for the presence of a disease-causing variant in an individual.
- The patent’s method aggregates variant-level effects into a burden score relating to survival or fitness effects but is not oriented toward probabilistic confidence quantification for causative genetic diagnosis per se.
- While Bayesian and deep learning techniques are referenced, they are applied for estimating pathogenicity scores or selection effects, not for integrating multiple layers of evidence into a genome-wide diagnosis probability.
- The technology in the patent is aimed at understanding population and individual fitness consequences, and clinical or financial decision support based on survival or fitness predictions, rather than estimating diagnosis likelihoods from variant observations.
- No claim or disclosure centered on *integrating prior variant observation probabilities with patient-specific variant presence/absence information* explicitly considering TP, FP, TN, FN outcomes for diagnostic certainty.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** Although this patent shares the theme of assessing genetic variant impact and uses selection coefficients and variant burdens to quantify fitness and lifespan effects, it fundamentally differs from Quant’s core innovation. Quant uniquely integrates *genome-wide prior probabilities* (e.g., from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium models) with observed and *missing* variant data (TP, FN) in a Bayesian framework to produce a posterior probability of *diagnostic certainty* for disease-causing variants. The reference’s focus on selection burden and survival models does not overlap with Quant’s methodology of probabilistic diagnosis confidence using variant-level prior and observation integration. Hence, it does not block Quant’s freedom to operate.
