#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Combined, ultrasensitive sequencing of corresponding leukocyte and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) identified true tumor-specific alterations predictive of clinical outcome after preoperative treatment and resection."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses ultrasensitive sequencing of matched cfDNA and leukocyte DNA to detect tumor-specific mutations in multiple cancers (gastric, colorectal, lung, esophageal).
- Specifically distinguishes tumor-derived mutations from hematopoietic (clonal hematopoiesis, CH) or germline mutations by comparative sequencing of leukocytes and cfDNA.
- Utilizes high-depth next-generation sequencing with error correction and statistical (Bayesian) models to remove false positives.
- Detects and quantifies variant allele fractions, correlates ctDNA levels longitudinally to clinical outcomes like pathological response, disease recurrence, progression-free and overall survival.
- Applies to cancer types including gastric, colorectal, lung, and esophageal cancers, as well as various clinical stages and perioperative settings.
- Emphasizes detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after surgery by ctDNA.
- Uses Bayesian modeling or probabilistic approaches to classify variants as tumor- or hematopoietic-derived based on variant allele fraction and occurrence in leukocyte sequencing.
- Incorporates paired-end sequencing, error filters, pathogenetic variant databases (e.g., COSMIC), and clinical outcome correlations.
- Provides solid evidence for monitoring treatment response, recurrence risk stratification, and patient selection for adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapies based on ctDNA dynamics.
- Includes detailed clinical trial analyses, including CRITICS trial (gastric cancer), colorectal cancer cohort, and immunotherapy-treated lung and esophageal cancer patients.
- Uses multiple time-point plasma samples and matched leukocyte DNA to achieve accurate detection of tumor-specific mutations.
- Identifies clonal hematopoiesis related variants and excludes them to improve specificity of ctDNA assays.
- Describes use of extensive public datasets (gnomAD, ClinVar, COSMIC) and integrates bioinformatics pipelines.

#### Key Differences

- Quant’s unique innovation lies specifically in integrating prior variant observation probabilities genome-wide under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and modeling false negatives to compute Bayesian posterior probabilities of a **complete genetic diagnosis confidence**, not merely identifying and quantifying tumor-specific mutations.
- This patent focuses on **detection and monitoring** of circulating tumor DNA mutations and discriminating tumor versus CH variants—but does not address:
  - Genome-wide prior probability modeling of pathogenic variants.
  - Quantifying probability of a complete genetic diagnosis from combined observed and missing variant data.
  - Modeling false negatives in sequencing coverage or variant detection.
  - Explicit credible intervals on diagnostic certainty in a Bayesian framework.
- The metastatic cancer and liquid biopsy context emphasizes tumor burden monitoring and molecular response, distinct from Quant’s rare disease genome-wide diagnostic probability modeling.
- Use of conventional deep sequencing and variant calling with filtering of CH variants is a known approach, whereas Quant claims novel Bayesian integration of prior probabilities and inheritance mode modeling.
- The patent primarily applies to somatic variant detection from plasma and WBC DNA in solid tumors, rather than germline variant diagnosis confidence quantification across genomes.

#### Conclusion

Potential overlap — recommend legal review.

---

The methods of this patent and Quant both:

- Use matched leukocyte and cfDNA sequencing to distinguish tumor-derived from CH-derived variants.
- Employ deep sequencing, variant filtering, and Bayesian/statistical modeling.

However, the patent focuses on somatic variant detection and disease monitoring, while Quant’s patented innovation centers on genome-wide Bayesian prior probability modeling for diagnostic confidence of rare germline variants, integrating false negatives, multiple inheritance modes, and producing credible intervals.

Because this patent closely relates to use of matched leukocyte and cfDNA sequencing data, Bayesian filtering of variants, and clinical outcome monitoring, **there is potential overlap with Quant’s approach**, particularly if Quant’s claims or freedom-to-operate scope includes such matched leukocyte-cfDNA analysis and Bayesian variant classification methods.

# Summary

This patent discloses a technology for:

- Detecting tumor-specific mutations in cfDNA by high-depth paired sequencing of plasma and leukocytes.
- Filtering or excluding hematopoietic-origin variants to improve specificity.
- Monitoring molecular response and MRD in various cancers.
- Using Bayesian statistical models to estimate tumor origin of variants absent from matched leukocyte sequencing.
- Clinical correlations to predict outcomes based on ctDNA dynamics.

This overlaps with core technical concepts in Quant involving Bayesian differentiation of variant origin using leukocyte data and cfDNA, though it does not emphasize Quant’s unique innovation of genome-wide prior probability integration and diagnostic certainty quantification.

Given the close technical resemblance in the leukocyte-guided Bayesian filtering concept, an FTO legal review is warranted.
