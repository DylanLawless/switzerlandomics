#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A mirror system includes a visual display disposed to convey information and images during an active period; and the visual display disposed to provide a reflected image during an inactive period; a multi-spectral 3D camera including a high definition video camera and an infrared camera; and a processor coupled to the visual display and the multi-spectral 3D camera."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent involves integration of various sensors (genetic sequencer/mass spectrometer) for collecting genetic data from bodily fluids, and combining this with 3D body modeling, physiological sensors (heart rate, temperature), and clinical data.  
- It uses processing that includes prediction of health conditions from observed genetic and physiological data over time.  
- The system aggregates multi-modal health data (genetic, clinical, physiological) for disease prediction and monitoring at both individual and population levels.  
- Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models are mentioned as part of the system's learning and inference machinery, which is conceptually related to probabilistic integration of clinical data.  
- The patent describes integration of multiple data sources including omics data (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), clinical records, behavioral and demographic data to generate health risk assessments.  
- Use of population-level analysis and modeling of disease risk, tracking pre-detectable characteristics and health trajectories are included.  
- Machine learning models for prediction and probabilistic reasoning about disease states and intervention success are described.  
- The patent also includes use of self-reported data, sensor data, and clinical claims data to create predictive models and perform Bayesian inference on health outcomes and interventions.

#### Key Differences

- The patent’s focus is on an integrated smart mirror system employing multiple sensing modalities for comprehensive health monitoring and behavior-driven interventions, centered around a physical mirror and augmented reality display.  
- Although Bayesian and probabilistic models are mentioned, they are embedded within a larger multi-sensor platform and workflow management rather than specifically focused on genome-wide variant prior probabilities or diagnostic confidence estimation based on TP/FN integration.  
- There are no explicit claims or descriptions of computing genome-wide prior probabilities of pathogenic variants under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, nor computing Bayesian posteriors to quantify diagnostic certainty informed by variant observation plus false negative consideration.  
- The patent does not describe explicitly modeling true positives, false negatives, and genome-wide aggregation of variant pathogenicity to estimate the confidence of a genetic diagnosis or credible intervals thereof, which is the core uniqueness of Quant.  
- The genomic data analysis here is described as one component among many health data streams; it does not isolate or emphasize genome-wide Bayesian integration of genetic variant probabilities tailored for clinical diagnostic certainty.  
- Patent claims focus on device/system components and integrated health monitoring functions; they do not claim specific algorithms or models structurally resembling Quant’s unique probabilistic framework.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.  

**Rationale:** This patent broadly covers a health-monitoring smart mirror system incorporating genetic analysis and Bayesian modeling among many features, but it does not overlap specifically with the core innovation of Quant — namely, the genome-wide computation of prior probabilities for pathogenic variants combined with TP/FN integration to derive Bayesian posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis with credible intervals. The technical theories and methods underlying Quant’s unique genetic diagnostic certainty modeling approach do not find close resemblance in this patent’s disclosed systems or claims.
