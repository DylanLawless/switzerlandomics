#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present application discloses a pattern recognition method and device for medical gene sequencing data ... The method includes preprocessing sequencing data with an adaptive sliding window based on local GC content, constructing an adaptive scoring matrix dynamically adjusted by neural network training, scanning sequence differences with sliding windows combined with Gaussian mixture model analysis to generate variant region information, constructing a base conversion matrix to classify mutation types, and using an improved clustering algorithm to identify mutation pattern types. This improves filtering quality and enhances complex mutation pattern detection."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent addresses variant detection and classification in gene sequencing data.
- Uses adaptive methods like sliding windows for variant region detection.
- Dynamic scoring matrices adjusted by neural networks to improve sequence alignment.
- Applies clustering algorithms on multi-dimensional feature vectors to characterize mutation patterns.
- Incorporates evolutionary conservation and base frequency (information entropy) in scoring.
- Mutation classification includes substitution, insertion, and deletion types.
- Complex mutation patterns (adjacent or associated mutations) are detected and clustered.
- Utilizes statistical and machine learning approaches to enhance variant detection accuracy.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses primarily on **pattern recognition and classification of variants** from raw sequencing data (preprocessing, base calling, dynamic alignment scoring, variant region detection).
- The core method does not integrate **prior probabilities of variant pathogenicity across genes or inheritance modes**.
- No explicit Bayesian framework is disclosed to combine prior variant observation probabilities with patient-specific observed and unobserved variant data (e.g., false negatives).
- Does not compute **posterior probabilities quantifying certainty of complete genetic diagnosis**, nor aims to quantify confidence intervals or diagnostic uncertainty at gene or genome scale.
- The approach is not designed for downstream clinical diagnosis confidence estimation but rather variant-level mutation pattern detection and clustering.
- No mention or use of true positive (TP), false negative (FN), or other contingency table concepts in a Bayesian diagnostic probability context.
- The patent’s adaptive scoring and clustering relate to sequence alignment and mutation pattern recognition, not probabilistic disease causality or diagnostic certainty integration.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

### Explanation

This patent primarily discloses a novel method for processing raw gene sequencing data for variant identification and mutation pattern characterization using adaptive scoring, machine learning, and clustering. While it employs some advanced concepts such as neural network-driven scoring matrices, adaptive sliding windows, and Gaussian mixture models, it does **not** address the specific quantitative integration of prior pathogenic variant probabilities with observed/missing variant data into a Bayesian posterior probability of a genetic diagnosis, which is the unique innovation of Quant.

Hence, despite some superficial and generic similarity in the domain of variant data processing and sequence analysis, the patent does **not** overlap with Quant’s unique method of quantifying the probability of a complete genetic diagnosis considering false negatives and population prior probabilities. The absence of any Bayesian diagnostic probability framework or TP/FN-based diagnosis certainty calculations means the patent is not blocking for Quant.
