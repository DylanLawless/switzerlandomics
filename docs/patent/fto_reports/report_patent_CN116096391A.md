#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure describes gene therapy systems and related methods that can be used to treat and/or prevent deafness caused by genetic mutations in the TMPRSS3 gene or the LOXHD1 gene. The compositions and methods disclosed herein use an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver the TRMPSS3 or LOXHD1 gene into the inner ear to restore the activity of the TMPRSS3 gene or the LOXHD1 gene, respectively, promote hair cell survival and restore hearing loss patient's hearing."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent focuses on gene therapy to treat hearing loss caused by specific gene mutations (TMPRSS3, LOXHD1).
- It involves delivery of functional gene copies via viral vectors (e.g., AAV) to inner ear cells.
- Addresses repair and/or rescue of degenerating hair cells and spiral ganglion cells—cell types affected by genetic mutations causing hearing loss.
- Use of promoters and viral vector serotypes to drive operable expression of therapeutic genes.
- Combination of gene therapy with cochlear implants to improve hearing restoration.
- Detailed mouse model data supporting efficacy of gene therapy.
- Gene-specific therapeutic approach for known genetic mutations causing hearing loss.

#### Key Differences

- The technology is a gene therapy system aimed at delivering functional genes (TMPRSS3, LOXHD1) to treat or prevent hearing loss.
- Does not address genomic variant probability estimation, prior or posterior probability calculations, or Bayesian statistical frameworks integrating TP, FN, TN, FP rates.
- No discussion or claim of quantifying diagnostic certainty or probability of complete genetic diagnosis from variant data.
- Focused on a therapeutic intervention at the molecular and cellular level rather than variant interpretation or diagnostic confidence modeling.
- No overlap or use of variant-level data integration, inheritance mode modeling, or credible intervals.
- Does not incorporate genome-wide data aggregation or probabilistic modeling of variant observability.
- No mention or use of computational algorithms estimating genetic diagnosis probability based on observed and unobserved variants.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
While this patent concerns genetic mutations in human genes and therapeutic interventions using gene therapy, it does not overlap with Quant’s core innovation. Quant’s unique approach involves genome-wide Bayesian integration of prior probabilities with patient variant data to produce posterior probabilities and diagnostic certainty intervals—not gene replacement or functional rescue. Therefore, this patent does not anticipate or block Quant’s method or software platform.
