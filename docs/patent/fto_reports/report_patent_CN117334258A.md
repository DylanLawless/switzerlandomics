#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The application discloses a multi-source heterogeneous human gene variation data management and annotation method and device for ACMG. The method includes: uniformly converting the storage methods and formats of multi-source heterogeneous data related to ACMG pathogenic variant ratings to form a database; adding a configuration item table in the database to configure display information for each data source field for dynamic front-end display; categorizing annotation information into variant-level and gene-level types according to ACMG guidelines; and adding data sources to disease gene variation data sets by creating configuration tables."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent addresses variant annotation and management of heterogeneous data sources involving variant and gene level information.
- It focuses on data integration, normalization of diverse variant databases, and dynamic configurable display of variant annotations.
- It explicitly references public databases and ACMG-guided variant pathogenicity classification data.
- The system supports customization of annotation data sources and rendering of variant annotation details on user interfaces.
- It deals with large-scale variant data management, facilitating clinical diagnostics support in line with ACMG guidelines.

#### Key Differences

- No mention or indication of probabilistic modeling of disease-causing variants beyond annotation or scoring.
- Does not address estimating prior probabilities of pathogenic variants genome-wide under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
- Lacks integration of observed variant data with missing/unobserved variant probabilities (false negatives).
- Does not incorporate Bayesian posterior estimation for diagnostic certainty or credible intervals.
- Primarily a data management, unification, and annotation system rather than a probabilistic diagnosis confidence platform.
- No claims or description involving True Positive (TP), False Negative (FN), False Positive (FP), True Negative (TN) integration or accounting for detection uncertainty.
- The invention centers on flexible data handling, annotation configuration, and user interface display rather than quantitative diagnostic probabilistics.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Rationale:**  
This patent focuses on management, integration, and dynamic annotation of multi-source variant data in accordance with ACMG guidelines. It does not describe or claim the Bayesian probabilistic methods central to Quant’s novelty — namely, the genome-wide prior probability computation of pathogenic variants under genetic models, integration of observed and unobserved variant data (TP/FN), or estimation of posterior diagnostic confidence with credible intervals. The patent’s scope is annotation and data display configuration rather than uncertainty quantification or diagnosis probability modeling. Therefore, it does not block Quant’s unique approach to genetic diagnosis confidence assessment.
