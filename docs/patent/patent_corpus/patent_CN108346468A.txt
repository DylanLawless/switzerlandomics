Specific implementation mode In order to enable those skilled in the art to better understand the solution of the present invention, below in conjunction in the embodiment of the present invention Attached drawing, technical scheme in the embodiment of the invention is clearly and completely described, it is clear that described embodiment is only The embodiment of a part of the invention, instead of all the embodiments.Based on the embodiments of the present invention, ordinary skill people The every other embodiment that member is obtained without making creative work should all belong to the model that the present invention protects It encloses. It should be noted that term ' first ' in description and claims of this specification and above-mentioned attached drawing, ' Two ' etc. be for distinguishing similar object, without being used to describe specific sequence or precedence.It should be appreciated that using in this way Data can be interchanged in the appropriate case, so as to the embodiment of the present invention described herein can in addition to illustrating herein or Sequence other than those of description is implemented.In addition, term ' comprising ' and ' having ' and their any deformation, it is intended that cover It includes to be not necessarily limited to for example, containing the process of series of steps or unit, method, system, product or equipment to cover non-exclusive Those of clearly list step or unit, but may include not listing clearly or for these processes, method, product Or the other steps or unit that equipment is intrinsic. For ease of user understand the present invention, below to the present embodiments relate to part term or noun make explanations： Hardy-Weinberg law refers in the ideal situation, the frequency of each allele and the genotype frequency of allele It is constant in heredity, that is, keeps genic balance.When allele only has a pair of (Aa), if the frequency of Gene A is P, base Because the audio of a is q, then A+a=p+q=1, AA+Aa+aa=P2+2pq+q2=1. OR, Odds Ratio, odds ratio. This application provides a kind of embodiments of data processing method. Fig. 1 is a kind of flow chart of data processing method according to the ... of the embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Figure 1, this method includes Following steps： Step S102 obtains the set of subject and the genotype in the relevant at least one site of target disease. Wherein, subject is not limited in the embodiment of the present invention, can is by inspection user, and target disease can be The crowd of a kind of disease type selected from all disease types, the corresponding genotype in each site has multiple, the present invention Various genes can be recorded in embodiment, and determine the set of genotype, the concrete type of gene is not limited It is fixed, such as homozygous mutant gene, heterozygous mutant gene, wild-type S gene. Step S104 calculates subject according to the value of the corresponding odds ratio OR of the genotype in each site and suffers from target disease Genotype risk probability. For above-mentioned steps, it can first assume that influence of each site to disease is independent from each other, then can calculate Go out joint OR value of multiple change points to disease, later, so that it may which the genotype to calculate each site suffers from target disease Genotype risk probability. Step S106 obtains the extraneous factor collection of subject, wherein extraneous factor collection includes relevant extremely with target disease The value of a few characteristics of human body. Above-mentioned steps can obtain the extraneous factor collection of subject, can both be referred to the extraneous factor of subject, So that it is determined that going out and the relevant environmental risk probability of subject, wherein above-mentioned extraneous factor collection can include but is not limited to：By Inspection person's gender, age, BMI (Body Mass Index, body-mass index can also refer to weight), cigarette smoking index, blood pressure refer to The indexes such as number, blood fat index, blood glucose, these extraneous factors can have corresponding Intrusion Index, each environmental factors can be right There should be external information index, so that it is determined that going out the comentropy of each environmental factors, then can be changed according to information gain maximum In generation, chooses optimal extraneous factor combination and is included in subsequent weight calculating, you can with according to each extraneous factor to the general of disease Rate determines Intrusion Index, and determines Weighted Index to each extraneous factor, according to Weighted Index, determines each extraneous factor to mesh Mark the influence power of disease. Optionally, above-mentioned extraneous factor can be obtained according to the physical examination result of user or voluntarily physical examination it is each A extraneous factor index.Each extraneous factor memory weighted calculation is concentrated using extraneous factor, finally according to each extraneous factor Weight, determine the higher extraneous factor of weighted value, obtain target extraneous factor collection.Then can to target extraneous factor collection into Row probability calculation, determine subject in the case that self-contained extraneous factor disease risk probability. Step S108 calculates the environmental risk probability that subject suffers from target disease according to the value of each characteristics of human body. Wherein, above-mentioned characteristics of human body can be every physical trait of user that detection obtains, can be it is extraneous because Value in element. Step S110 suffers from the synthesis of target disease according to genotype risk probability and environmental risk probability calculation subject Risk probability.
