- **Publication No.:** US20190206571A1

#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Systems and methods are disclosed herein for recommending disease related content based on a disease associated with a user. A user may request his or her genetic testing data. That genetic testing data may then be used to determine which genetic disease the user may possess. Furthermore, the genetic testing data may indicate genetically-linked offspring of the user that may also be affected by a mutation that can lead to a genetic disease. The media guidance application may then recommend disease-related content to both the user and offspring."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- This patent relates to handling and retrieving genetic testing data associated with a first user (e.g., a father), identifying genetic diseases related to that user, and determining genetic links with other users (e.g., offspring) based on genetic data.
- It involves comparing genetic data between related users and evaluating the likelihood that these genetically-linked users may have the same disease risk.
- Based on exceeding certain likelihood thresholds, recommending disease-related media content to genetically-linked users.
- Includes managing and presenting disease-related content, accounting for age appropriateness, presence of additional users, and privacy (blocking content for non-genetically linked viewers).
- Uses databases such as 23andMe for genomic data and disease-likelihood associations.
- Employs user profiles with genetic data and social network connections for targeted content delivery.
- Incorporates user interface elements such as playlists, avatars, and disease display modules to communicate content based on genetic risk.

#### Key Differences

- The patentâ€™s core focus is on **media guidance and content recommendation** systems leveraging existing genetic test results for tailoring **educational or informational content** delivery related to genetic diseases.
- It does **not address any direct probabilistic modeling or Bayesian computation** integrating:
  - Prior probabilities of pathogenic variant occurrences genome-wide.
  - Observed vs. missing variant data (false negatives).
  - Mode of inheritance impact modeling on variant observing probability.
  - Posterior probabilities or credible intervals quantifying diagnostic confidence.
- The patent lacks any method for quantitatively estimating or integrating true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true negative (TN), and false positive (FP) probabilities in the context of genetic diagnosis.
- No technical steps involve calculating genome-wide variant prior probabilities under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium or Bayesian updating based on variant observation status.
- Instead, it uses **retrieved genetic test results and likelihood indicators as provided by third-party databases** (e.g., 23andMe) without further statistical or probabilistic inference.
- The functionality revolves around **user interface, privacy, and content filtering**, rather than genomic variant pathogenicity quantification or genetic diagnostic confidence estimation.
- Does not provide a framework for genome-wide variant probability computation or clinical diagnosis confidence scores.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** Although this patent involves genetic data, disease likelihoods, and identification of genetically-linked individuals, it is fundamentally a media recommendation system utilizing existing genetic test results as input data. It does not disclose or claim the key technical innovation of Quant, namely the Bayesian integration of genome-wide prior pathogenic variant probabilities with observed/missing variant data to compute genetic diagnosis posterior probabilities and credible intervals. The mere use of genetic likelihood data for the purpose of recommending disease-related content is not sufficiently similar to Quant's diagnostic confidence quantification methodology.
