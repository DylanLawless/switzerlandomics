	abstract = {We present a novel framework for quantifying the prior probability of observing disease-associated variants in any gene for a given phenotype. By integrating large-scale genomic annotations, including population allele frequencies and ClinVar variant classifications, with Hardy-Weinberg-based calculations, our method estimates per-variant observation probabilities under autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), and X-linked modes of inheritance. Applied to 557 genes implicated in primary immunodeficiency and inflammatory disease, our approach generated 54,814 variant probabilities. First, these detailed, pre-calculated results provide robust priors for any gene-disease combination. Second, a score positive total metric summarises the aggregate pathogenic burden, serving as an indicator of the likelihood of observing a patient with the disease and reflecting genetic constraint. Validation in NFKB1 (AD) and CFTR (AR) disorders confirmed close concordance between predicted and observed case counts. The resulting datasets, available in both machine-readable and human-friendly formats, support Bayesian variant interpretation and clinical decision-making. 1Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study used only openly available statistic data from GnomAD, Clinvar, and PanelAppRex as cited in the manuscript.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Variant set association tests (VSAT), especially those incorporating rare variants via variant collapse, are invaluable in genetic studies. However, unlike Manhattan plots for single-variant tests, VSAT statistics lack intrinsic genomic coordinates, hindering visual interpretation. To overcome this, we developed the Archipelago method, which assigns a meaningful genomic coordinate to VSAT P values so that both set-level and individual variant associations can be visualised together. This results in an intuitive and information rich illustration akin to an archipelago of clustered islands, enhancing the understanding of both collective and individual impacts of variants. In a validation study using 504 East Asian subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (250 cases, 254 controls), we first conducted a single-variant GWAS using logistic regression with Firth correction. We then performed an equivalent case/control analysis by collapsing variants into protein pathways (defined via STRINGdb and PreoMCLustR) and testing associations with SKAT-O. The Archipelago plot is applicable in any genetic association study that uses variant collapse to evaluate both individual variants and variant sets, and its customizability facilitates clear communication of complex genetic data. By integrating at least two dimensions of genetic data into a single visualization, VSAT results can be easily read and aid in identification of potential causal variants in variant sets such as protein pathways.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any fundingAuthor DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study uses previously public dataset of 504 East Asian individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (version 5, hg19) available at http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Introduction Children represent a large and vulnerable patient group. However, the evidence-base for most paediatric diagnostic and therapeutic procedures remains limited or is often inferred from adults. There is urgency to improve paediatric health care provision based on real-world evidence generation. The digital transformation is a unique opportunity to shape a data-driven, agile, learning health care system and deliver more efficient and personalized care to children and their families. The goal of SwissPedHealth is to build a sustainable and scalable infrastructure to make routine clinical data from paediatric hospitals in Switzerland interoperable, standardized, quality-controlled, and ready for observational research, quality assurance, trials, and health-policy creation. This paper describes the design, aims, and current achievements of SwissPedHealth.Methods and analysis SwissPedHealth started in September 2022 as one of four National Data Streams co-funded by the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) and the Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT). SwissPedHealth develops modular governance and regulatory strategies, and harnesses SPHN automatization procedures, in collaboration with clinical data warehouses, the Data Coordination Center, Biomedical Information Technology Network, and other SPHN institutions and funded projects. The SwissPedHealth consortium is led by a multi-site, multi-disciplinary Steering Committee incorporating patient and family representatives. The data stream contains work packages focusing on: 1) governance and implementation of standardized data collection, 2) nested projects to test the feasibility of the data stream, 3) a lighthouse project that enriches the data stream by integrating multi-omics data, aiming to improve diagnoses of rare diseases, and 4) engagement with families through patient and public involvement activities and bioethics interviews.Ethics and dissemination The health database regulation of SwissPedHealth was approved by the ethics committee (AO_2022-00018). Research findings will be disseminated through national and international conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals and in lay language via online media and podcasts.ARTICLE SUMMARY⍰ The paediatric national data stream SwissPedHealth focuses on routine clinical data from children at Swiss University Children{\textquoteright}s Hospitals, spans disciplines and is built in a scalable and modular way in terms of governance, data infrastructure, and patient and public involvement, to enable a gradual increase in coverage of the Swiss child population.⍰ SwissPedHealth strives to increase readiness for quality improvement, research, and personalized paediatric health care.⍰ SwissPedHealth{\textquoteright}s infrastructure aligns with the national frameworks, safeguarding data security and adhering to a standard interoperability framework based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF).⍰ SwissPedHealth seeks to explore integration of data from external sources such as federal statistics, cohorts, and registries, which have their own governance and data formats.{\textbullet} SwissPedHealth investigates the use of multi-omics workflows to improve diagnosis of rare diseases in children with life-threatening phenotypesCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis project was supported through the grant NDS-2021-911 (SwissPedHealth) from the Swiss Personalized Health Network (SPHN) and the Strategic Focal Area Personalized Health and Related Technologies (PHRT) of the ETH Domain (Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The ethics committee Northwest and Central Switzerland (EKNZ, AO_2022-00018) gave ethical approval for the health database regulation of SwissPedHealth.
