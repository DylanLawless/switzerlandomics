#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A method of identifying a variant as a somatic variant derived from cell free DNA (cfDNA) identifies the variant at a locus based on differences between the nucleic acid sequence for a cfDNA fragment in a plurality of cfDNA fragments and a nucleic acid sequence for the locus in a reference sequence, where the cfDNA fragments are from a liquid biopsy sample from a subject. A set of cfDNA fragments comprising the variant, in the plurality of cfDNA fragments, determines fragment length metrics. A variant allele fraction (VAF) is determined based on comparison of the number of cfDNA fragments having the variant and the total number of cfDNA fragments mapping to the locus. Clonal hematopoiesis prevalence metrics for the variant are obtained. The fragment length metrics, VAF, and hematopoiesis metrics are inputted into a model thereby obtaining, as model output, whether the variant is a somatic variant derived from cfDNA."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of fragment length metrics derived from cfDNA fragments encompassing candidate variants.
- Calculation of variant allele fraction (VAF) from cfDNA sequencing data.
- Integration of clonal hematopoiesis (CH) prevalence metrics to differentiate somatic tumor variants from CH variants.
- Input of these multi-modal features (fragment length metrics, VAF, clonal hematopoiesis prevalence) into a computational model (e.g., random forest, regression, or similar machine learning model) to classify variants as somatic or non-somatic.
- Consideration of false positive and false negative variant calls.
- Model training and validation on datasets of matched liquid biopsy, tumor tissue, and germline samples.
- Use of Bayesian or machine learning-based classifiers to resolve ambiguity in variant origin.
- Features of the model include metrics very close to those used in Quant: fragment size distribution (median, skewness, kurtosis), statistical tests comparing fragment length distributions, allele frequency residuals relative to tumor fraction estimates.
- Explicitly addresses false negatives and potential missing data by probabilistic modeling, although with different detailed focus.
- Outputs variant-level somatic vs. non-somatic classification with quantitative confidence.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses primarily on somatic variant classification in the specific context of liquid biopsy for oncology, distinguishing tumor from clonal hematopoiesis and germline variants, using fragment length and variant allele frequency features.
- Quant’s unique innovation is the genome-wide calculation of prior probabilities for pathogenic variants integrated with observed variant data and plausible false negatives to yield Bayesian posterior probabilities of full genetic diagnosis – i.e., not just variant-level classification, but gene- and genome-level diagnostic certainty with credible intervals, integrating inheritance mode impacts.
- The patent does not appear to model or estimate genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants, nor does it describe integration under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium assumptions for variant pathogenicity probabilities.
- The patent’s model uses fragment-level molecular features and historical CH prevalence in a machine learning model primarily to classify variants as tumor or non-tumor, rather than computing genome-wide prior and posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis accounting for TP, FP, TN, FN at a patient/disease level.
- Quant explicitly quantifies false negative probabilities to assess diagnostic certainty, a feature not detailed in the patent.
- Patent scope focuses on ctDNA variant classification for precision oncology therapy selection, particularly detecting CH confounding variants.
- Quant is broadly genome-wide, inheritance-mode aware, and provides credible intervals on overall diagnosis confidence, supporting both diagnosis and population studies.
- Bayesian framework in Quant emphasizes integration of prior probabilities with observed/missing data, in contrast to primarily supervised classification of variants in the patent.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

The patent teaches a machine learning method to classify somatic vs. clonal hematopoiesis variants in cfDNA using fragment size, variant allele fraction, and CH prevalence data, which partially overlaps with Quant’s use of fragment length and VAF in variant evaluation. However, it does not disclose or claim the genome-wide Bayesian prior probability modeling, integration of computed false negative probabilities, or calculation of posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis with credible intervals across all genes and inheritance modes, which are core, distinctive innovations in Quant. The patent’s narrower focus on variant-level lineage classification in liquid biopsy oncology distinguishes it from the broader diagnostic confidence quantification framework in Quant.

# Summary

The referenced patent US20250179586A1 overlaps with Quant in use of fragment length metrics, variant allele fractions, and clonal hematopoiesis prevalence metrics combined in a machine learning model to classify somatic vs. non-somatic variants detected from cfDNA. However, the patent does not disclose Quant’s key innovations of genome-wide prior probability estimation under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, integration of prior probabilities with observed and missing data including false negative modeling, and generation of Bayesian posterior probabilities quantifying confidence of a complete genetic diagnosis for all genes and inheritance modes. Hence, despite some similar terminology and fragment-level approaches, the patent does not block Quant’s core diagnostic certainty and genomic diagnosis probability platform.
