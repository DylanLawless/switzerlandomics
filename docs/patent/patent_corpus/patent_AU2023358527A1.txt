PET imaging of RELN-COLBOS (H3447R) carrier. (A) Representative PiB PET amyloid (top left row) and Fluortaucipir tau PET (bottom left row) imaging of (PSEN1 E280A; RELN-COLBOS) case (left panel) as compared to a PSEN1 E280A mutation carrier with MCI at typical age (right panel). For both measurements, specific binding of the tracer is represented using a scale with the lowest (0 ^8 DVR or SUVR) and the highest (2 ^00 DVR or SUVR) degree of binding. The right side of Panel A shows a representative 18F-fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET precuneus cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgI) of the (PSEN1 E280A; RELN- COLBOS) case (left panel) as compared to a PSEN1 E280A mutation carrier with MCI at typical age (right panel). Binding affinity of the dye is represented using a scale with the lowest (0 ^5 SUVR) and the highest (2 ^1 SUVR) degree of binding. (B) Dot plot analysis of brain imaging measurements shown in Panel A for amyloid burden, tau burden, glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume. Brain imaging measurements of the (PSEN1 E280A; RELN-COLBOS) case compared to the previously published (PSEN1 E280A; APOEch) homozygote case, unimpaired PSEN1 E280A carriers (n=13-18) and younger MCI PSEN1 E280A carriers (n=7-11) (2). Some previously published data points are included in the figures presented here because they are the only available data for comparison (2). Mean cortical-to- cerebellar distribution volume ratios (DVR) was used to quantify the amyloid burden across individuals; entorhinal-to-cerebellar SUVRs was used to quantify tau burden; hippocampal-to-whole brain volume ratios is used to compare changes in hippocampal volume; precuneus-to whole-brain CMRgl ratios is used to compare changes in glucose metabolism between different cohorts. Data expressed as individual values with mean ± s. e. m. (C) Anatomic details of tau burden in temporal lobe cortex. Flat-map representations of right hemisphere temporal lobe cortex for regions of interest (top-left, PPC=posterior parahippocampal cortex, ERC=entorhinal cortex), with tau PET (Fluortaucipir, FTP) overlay for four cases. Asymptomatic PSEN1 E280A mutation carrier was 38 years old. PSEN1 E280A mutation carrier with typical MCI was 44 years old. The PSEN1 carrier with RELN-COLBOS mutation was notable for having a relatively lower tau burden in medial temporal regions (ERC and PPC), compared to an asymptomatic PSEN1 E280A mutation carrier and a PSEN1 E280A mutation carrier with MCI at typical age of onset. FIGs.2A-M. The RELN H3448R variant enhances Dab1 signaling and the affinity of C-terminus region of RELN (CTR-RELN) to heparin, reduced tau hyperphosphorylation and preserved motor functions in mice. (A) Representative western blotting band of pDAB1 levels (top) and total protein staining (bottom) levels in primary mouse cortical neuron cells treated five min. at 37 ºC with 4 µg/ml of full- length RELN WT or RELN H3448R, mouse orthologue of H3447R RELN. (MOCK; P< 0 ^0029), and RELN WT (P=0 ^0246). Data is presented as mean ± s. e. m. and analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis (Dunn’s post-hoc analysis for multiple comparisons of n=4 independent experiments. (B) Spectroscopic analysis of heparin chromatography fractions of the CTR-RELN WT and CTR-RELN H3447R variant eluted in an increasing gradient of NaCl (0 ^05 M NaCl step gradient) in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer and detected via UV absorbance at 280 nm. Data is expressed as percentage of input over NaCl gradient fractions from 0 ^4 M to 5 M NaCl. Data is showing that 0 ^55 M NaCl can displace CTR-RELN WT binding from a heparin column. The affinity for heparin of the CTR-RELN increases in presence of the H3447R mutation, as suggested by the shift of the peak with maximum height of eluted fraction from 0 ^55 M to 0 ^7 M NaCl. N=3 independent experiments. Error bars represent s. e. m. (C) Representative sensorgrams of the binding analysis between chip sensors coated with heparin and increasing concentrations of CTR-RELN variants at concentrations ranging from 0 to 25 nM. Data expressed as response units over time in seconds. Equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) for each SPR analysis are shown inside the graph and support the difference in affinity binding between heparin and CTR-RELN variants: H3447R (right plot, KD=3 ^75e-9 M-1s-1)>H3347 (left plot, KD=6 ^53e-9 M- 1s-1). Sensorgrams of CTR-RELN with the H3447K and H3447D control variants are reported in Fig.7A-B for comparison. (D) Representative WB of pDab1 levels (top blots) and GAPDH levels (bottom blots) detected in the cerebellum of both females (left) and males (right) either wild type (RELN WT/WT), heterozygous (RELN WT/H3448R) or homozygous (RELN H3448R/H3448R) for the mRELN H3448R mutation. Levels were detected in 6-12 months old mice. (E,F) Quantifications of pDab1 levels normalized to GAPDH and expressed as fold change of RELN WT showing a genotype effect in pDab1 levels in male mice (F. p=0 ^0284 for WT/WT vs. H3448R/H3448R; p=0 ^0037 for WT/H3448R vs. H3448R/H3448R, One-way ANOVA) and not in female mice (E). G, Isothermal calorimetry measurements of short variants CTR-RELN WT (left plot) and CTR-RELN H3447R (right plot) titrated with 5 ^M heparin. Affinity calculations are reported on top of each plots. H, Binding analysis via BLI between Fc-fusion CTR-RELN WT or H3447R and a heparin coated biosensor. Association (ka) and dissociation constants (kd) are used to calculate the equilibrium disassociation constant (KD) that is displayed in the plot. I, Docking of CTR-RELN WT (purple) with a representative heparin molecule (cyan). AAs in the RELN CTR that have polar contacts with heparin are highlighted in magenta. J, Representative IHC images from the hippocampus of WT / WT, WT / RELN H3448R, hTau tg / WT and hTau tg / RELN H3448R mice stained with ptau T205 antibody. hTau tg / WT mice showed neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in CA1 and dentate gyrus, while hTau tg / RELN H3448R showed tau pathology to a lesser degree (soma of an affected neuron depicted with a dotted line). Bar = 100 μm. K, Bar graph for ptau T205 signal intensity values in hTau tg / WT (n = 3 mice) and hTau tg / RELN H3448R mice (n = 3 mice). The latter showed significantly less signal intensity values. p = 0.022 *, two sided Student’s T. Test. Error bars represent standard deviation from mean. L, Representative phenotype observed during the tail elevation test and the relative score (0 = severely impaired, 1: 50% impaired; 2 = normal). M, Tail elevation score recorded on RELNWT/Tau-P301L (n = 13 male mice) and RLN-H3448R H3448R/Tau-P301L crossed male mice (n = 11 male mice) shows a significantly improved tail elevation score in the presence of the RLN-H3448R variant as compared to Tau-P301L mice expressing RLN WT (*p = 0.0305, two-tailed unpaired T Test, t = 2.313, df = 22). Box plots expressed as minimum to maximum values around average. FIGs.3A-E. Neuropathological characterization of the (PSEN1 E280A; RELN H3447R) case. (A) is reported amyloid beta (A ^^) and hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) pathologies in CA1 and EC. Both pathologies present wide distribution and intensity, A ^^ pathology shows diffuse plaques with varied distribution and size in both structures (panels and insets). ptau pathology shows varied density of neurofibrillary tangles and diffuse tau pathology. Scale bar =500 mm. (B) shows representative images of neurons stained with Kluver-Barrera in CA1 and EC of the PSEN1 E280A RELN-COLBOS (RELN-COLBOS) case, the PSEN1 E280A/APOE Christchurch (APOEch) case, an average onset PSEN1E280A familial Alzheimer’s (FAD) case and a sporadic Alzheimer’s (SAD) case. Scale bar=125 mm. (C) 3D scatter plot graph for A ^^, ptau and neuronal density for EC and CA1 from RELN- COLBOS, APOEch, FAD and SAD cases. The EC in the RELN-COLBOS case shows the highest neuronal density while presenting with low A ^^ and ptau pathologies. In contrast, CA1 in the same case shows low neuronal density together with high levels of A ^^ and ptau pathologies. For all other cases, neuronal density in both areas is low while presenting with varied levels of A ^^ or ptau pathology. (D) Representative images of RELN-CT and ApoE staining of the RELN-COLBOS, APOEch, FAD and SAD cases in EC and CA1. The RELN-COLBOS case shows stronger background signal in both structures with lesser intraneuronal signal for RELN-CT in EC. Similarly, the APOEch case shows lower intraneuronal signal in EC with the RELN-CT antibody and very low intraneuronal signal in both structures with the ApoE antibody (magnified right panel). Finally, ApoE staining shows noticeable plaque-like and tangle-like signals in FAD and SAD cases in both structures, EC and CA1. Scale bars=100 mm and 25 mm in the magnified panel. (E) Representative images of Kluver Barrera staining of whole hippocampal and parahippocampal sections (above), together with representative magnified images of parahippocampal subcortical white matter stained with RELN-CT antibody in the RELN-COLBOS, APOEch, FAD and SAD cases. The RELN-COLBOS case showed increased white matter luxol fast blue signal intensity, while RELN-COLBOS and SAD cases showed increased intracellular RELN-CT signal in white matter. Scale bars=2 ^5 mm for above and 25 µm below panels. FIGs.4A-D. A putative model for ADAD pathology modifications APOEch and RELN H3447R PS1E280A cases. In normal conditions (A), RELN and ApoE can bind to VLDLr/APOER2 receptors complex aided by GAG; the modulation of this signaling pathway maintains physiological Dab1 activation (phosphorylation indicated by a circle), which keeps basal phosphorylation levels of GSK3β and tau phosphorylation (left panel). In the APOE Christchurch case, ApoE decreased binding to GAG allows increased RELN binding to the receptor complex, increasing Dab1 activation and inhibiting GSK3β and tau phosphorylation (middle panel B). In the presence of the RELN H3447R variant, increased RELN binding to GAG leads to enhanced Dab1 activation and subsequent inhibition of GSK3β and tau phosphorylation (right panel C). (D) Model of protective state wherein increased Reelin signaling and or reduced ApoE signaling have a beneficial effect. FIGs.5A-B. Subject’s genealogy and Sanger validation of the C-terminus RELN H3447R variant. (A) Subject’s genealogy. Circles representing females, squares representing males, diamonds representing individuals whose gender has been masked for privacy. Arrowhead depicts proband case. Deceased individuals are marked with a crossed bar. Black shapes indicate affected individuals and white shapes indicate unaffected individuals. (B) Representative DNA Sanger sequencing of amplicon in RELN gene from a carrier that does not carry the mutation (RELN/RELN, top panel), as compared to the individual carrying the variant (RELN/RELN H3447R, bottom panel). Region of the H3447R mutation is highlighted by the black circle. FIGs.6A-B. Treatments with RELN H3448R reduces tau phosphorylation in vitro. (A) Representative western blotting of ptau (Ser396, top blot), tau (Tau5, middle blot) and GAPDH (bottom blot) detected in primary mouse cortical neurons treated one h with either vehicle, RELN H3448 wild type (RELN WT) or RELN H3448R. (B) Quantification of normalized intensities of n=3 independent experiments showing a significant increase in ptau/tau ratio in neurons treated with RELN H3448R as compared to vehicle (p =0 ^03, unpaired T-test). FIGs.7A-B. Mutations at position 3447 in the CTR domain of RELN impact heparin binding. (A, B) Representative sensorgrams of the binding analysis between chip sensors coated with heparin and increasing concentrations of CTR- reelin variants ranging from 0 to 25 nM. Sensorgrams for RELN H3447K (A) and RELN H3447D (B). Data expressed as response units over time in seconds. Equilibrium dissociation constants (kD) for each SPR analysis are shown inside the graph and supports the difference binding between heparin and reelin variants in the order H3447R (Figure 2C, KD=3 ^75e-9 M-1s-1) > WT (Figure 2C, KD=6 ^53e-9 M-1s- 1) > H3447K (A, KD=7 ^33e-9 M-1s-1) >>> H3447D (B, KD=1 ^64e-7 M-1s-1) when compared to data presented in Figure 2. FIG.8. Reelin C-terminal consensus across 128 mammalian species. Analysis of Reelin sequences across mammalian species shows that the CTR is highly conserved. Basic AAs might play a role in binding GAGs or lipoprotein receptors. FIG.9. Orientation of select basic amino acids in the heparin-binding motif. Analysis of Reelin sequences across mammalian species shows that the CTR is highly conserved. Basic AAs might play a role in binding GAGs or lipoprotein receptors. Position 3447 (arrow) orient in the same direction as a majority of other arginines. Arginines in 3446 position and 3453 may also interact with heparin as part of the heparin-binding motif but are oriented differently from most basic AAs. R3452 and R3457 are part of the heparin-binding motif but are unlikely to contribute to heparin interaction since they are each oriented differently from the other basic amino acids in the potential binding site. FIG.10. Twenty lowest-energy structures of Reelin CTR produced by 2D NMR. Structures show that there is a region of flexibility towards the c-terminal of the peptide, including the H3447R mutation. FIGs.11A-D. Representative HPLC chromatograms of Reelin-peptide variants. (A) Zero (R3446H), one (WT), or two (H3447R) basic amino acids in positions 3446 – 3447 show increased interaction with heparin, indicated by later peak retention time in isocratic 1M KCl elution. (B) This pattern held for short and long peptides. n = 2 repeats, within <0.5min of representative peaks. (C) Short reelin variants had earlier peak retention times in comparison to long reelin variants (D); however, both short and long peptides are similarly affected by AA substitutions at position 3447. H3447D had an earlier peak retention time in comparison to WT. Basic substitutions H3447K and H3447R had increased later peak retention times, therefore indicating increased interaction with heparin. n = 2 repeats, within <0.5min of representative peaks. FIGs.12A-B. Surface plasmon resonance to assay Reelin CTR-Heparin binding kinetics. Binding between H3447 (A) or H3447R (B) and a heparin coated metal film.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Efforts to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have focused on removing amyloid, a neuropathological hallmark. The present inventors have characterized over 5,000 individuals from a Colombian kindred with autosomal- dominant AD (ADAD) due to the E280A mutation in Presenilin-1 (PSEN1) of which about 1,200 are mutation carriers. PSEN1-E280A carriers usually develop cognitive impairment in their forties. E280A carriers develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) by the median age of 44 years (95% CI, 43-45) and dementia by 49 years (95% CI, 49-50), (1) with rare exceptions (2). We reported a female PSEN1 E280A carrier with two copies of the APOE3 Christchurch (APOEch, R136S) mutation who remained cognitively unimpaired for nearly thirty years after the expected age at clinical onset (2). The present disclosure is based in part on the clinical, in vivo neuroimaging, genetic and neuropathological characteristics of a male case from the same population with the PSEN1 E280A mutation, who also presented with an extreme phenotype of delayed age at clinical onset of ADAD. We characterized a male heterozygous for the RELN-COLBOS variant who was resilient to the cognitive impairment associated with the PSEN1 E280A mutation until age 67. The observation of low tau pathology and increased neuronal density in the entorhinal cortex as compared to other AD cases implicates this brain region in RELN-mediated mechanisms relevant to protection against AD (Table 2 & FIGs.3A- E). A female sibling carrier of the RELN-COLBOS and PSEN1 E280A variants also presented with delayed age at onset of cognitive decline, though less optimal protection compared to her brother, and prolonged end-stage disease. RELN-specific sexual dimorphism may have contributed to her distinct features. We cannot rule out the possibility that other factors may have contributed to the AD resilience phenotype in the RELN-COLBOS carriers. Others identified RELN as a candidate gene associated with AD pathology in cognitively healthy individuals (26) and DAB1 variants were linked to AD risk in APOE4 homozygotes further linking the RELN/DAB1 pathway to Alzheimer’s.(27). The present inventors previously reported a female case homozygous for APOE3 Christchurch who was resistant to ADAD-related dementia, had widespread amyloid pathology and low tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex (2). Tauopathy was more extensive in the RELN-COLBOS case compared to the APOE3 Christchurch homozygote, except for the entorhinal cortex, which was largely spared in both, suggesting resilience in the RELN-COLBOS case. The hypermorphic effect of RELN is mild. This is the first known report of a RELN hypermorph, and a stronger effect may not support proper development in this critical signaling process. The experimental evidence of a gain-of-function mechanism for the RELN-COLBOS variant, and the fact that a patient with extreme protection against ADAD has it, establish a rationale for genetic implication in the observed phenotypes. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is hypothesized that RELN-COLBOS is not a neutral variant and is likely to contribute to the resilience phenotype of the subject. The APOE Christchurch mutation impairs ApoE binding to GAG and the ApoE receptors (2, 28). Conversely, as shown herein, the RELN-COLBOS variant enhances RELN binding to GAG and (Neurophilin 1) NRP1, possibly giving it a competitive advantage for binding to its receptors (4). RELN-COLBOS binding to GAGs or heparan sulphate proteoglycans may increase local concentrations of RELN leading to enhanced signaling. The present analyses of the RELN-COLBOS case revealed a converging mechanism potentially linking ApoE and RELN interactions via GAG or other receptors to the protection against AD. RELN-COLBOS is a gain- of-function variant showing stronger ability to activate its canonical protein target Dab1 and reduce human tau phosphorylation in a knock-in mouse. Regulation of this APOE-RELN protective pathway, particularly in the entorhinal cortex, may have a profound therapeutic impact on the resistance to tau pathology and neurodegeneration, and resilience against cognitive decline and dementia in Alzheimer’s disease. Measurements of metabolic rate for glucose in the precuneus-to-whole brain region using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET showed a slightly higher level of glucose metabolism compared to the mean levels of typical MCI carriers from the kindred, who were of much younger ages (Fig.1a-b). Methods of Treating and Reducing Risk of Cognitive Decline and Dementia Provided herein are methods for treating or reducing risk of developing or worsening cognitive decline and dementia. The methods can include administering a RELN protein, e.g., a full-length RELN recombinant protein or a mini-RELN recombinant protein or variant thereof as described herein (see, e.g., Table A), optionally wherein the protein comprises a variant described herein, e.g., an H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation, or a nucleic acid encoding the RELN protein. R3455A provides resistance to Furin cleavage of the CTR of Reelin (Kohno et al., J Neurosci.2015 Mar 18; 35(11): 4776–4787). Alternatively or in addition, the methods can include administering a gene editing agent that alters at least one allele in a cell to include a H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation, to an agent that increases expression or activity of reelin, e.g., an agent that reduces methylation of the reelin (e.g., a crispr/cas-demethylase fusion). In some embodiments, the methods include administering the proteins (and guide RNAs/ssODNs as needed) directly; administering nucleic acids encoding the proteins (and guide RNAs/ssODNs as needed), e.g., as naked DNA or mRNA or in expression vectors, e.g., viral vectors, or administering cells that express the proteins (and guide RNAs/ssODNs as needed). For example, naked DNA can be administered without a vector using electroporation devices (e.g. in the ciliary body of the eye). Alzheimer's disease The methods described herein may be used to treat or reduce the risk of developing subjects with all types of Alzheimer’s disease including, but not limited to, familial and sporadic Alzheimer’s disease, early onset or late onset Alzheimer’s disease. In some embodiments, the present methods may be used to treat or reduce the risk of development of early onset familial form of Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cognitive decline associated with aging. Typically, increasing forgetfulness or mild confusion are early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Gradually, cognitive impairment associated with Alzheimer's disease leads to memory loss, especially recent memories, disorientation and misinterpreting spatial relationships, difficulty in speaking, writing, thinking, reasoning, changes in personality and behavior resulting in depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, mood swings, distrust in others, irritability and aggressiveness, changes in sleeping habits, wandering, loss of inhibitions, delusions, and eventually death. Other neurodegenerative diseases, disorders or conditions In addition to Alzheimer’s disease, the present methods may be used to treat other neurodegenerative diseases, disorders or conditions, including frontotemporal dementia, various types of memory loss, cognitive impairment including but not limited to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or other conditions associated with accumulation of β amyloid or accumulation of tau or other proteopathies like frontotemporal dementia, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or cognitive decline associated with aging. Neurodegenerative diseases can also include diseases of the eye like age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy or inherited retinal degeneration, stroke, brain trauma or concussion, retinal trauma, inherited retinal degenerations, small vessel disease like cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) or aberrant angiogenesis. Other applications include conditions genetically associated with RELN loss-of-function including lateral temporal epilepsy, autism, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) schizophrenia, and bipolar disease, as well as cortex lamination defects, abnormal neuronal migration, and cerebellar hypotrophy). See, e.g. Shifman et al., 2008; Ober et al., 2008; Goes et al., 2010; Seripa et al., 2008; Fehér et al., 2015; Kelemenova et al., 2009; and Abo El Fotoh et al., 2020. Reelin and mini-Reelin Reelin useful in the methods and compositions described herein can include full-length wild type reelin, as well as truncated and deletion variants thereof that retain function of the full-length protein, i.e., the ability to bind HSPGs and/or bind to receptors like APOER2 or VLDLR, and/or lead to the activation of downstream targets like Dab1 or promote resilience of neurons or glial cells, and/or bind to NRP1. Exemplary full length human reelin sequences include the following: * Variant 1 represents the longer transcript, and encodes the longer isoform a. **Variant 2 lacks an in-frame, 6 nt microexon in the coding region compared to variant 1, resulting in an isoform b that is 2 aa shorter than isoform a. In some embodiments, the methods and compositions described herein us a sequence that is at least 80%.85%, 90%, 95%, or 99% identical to human reelin. In some embodiments, a mini-RELN (minimum RELN) is used. An exemplary mini-RELN can include a sequence as described herein; the mini RELN constructs can optionally include protein linkers between these domains, e.g., comprising amino acids between the domains that don’t affect function such as Gly- Ser linkers; many others are known in the art, see, e.g., Chen et al., 2012. In some embodiments, the mini-RELN comprises: A) a signal peptide, (B) an oligomerizationdomain, e.g., a dimerization domain, e.g., a CR-50 Domain, (C) an APOER2/VLDLR binding domain, e.g., reelin domains 5 and 6 (R5-6), and (D) GAG binding domain/cell penetrating peptide, e.g., a C-terminus from reelin, e.g., as described herein, e.g., in Table A. TABLE A – elements of Mini RELN Additional sequences, e.g., from RELN, can also be included, but the mini-RELN is not the same as the full length RELN. Mini-RELN may be preferable because it is easier to administer, cheaper to produce, and feasible to deliver for expression in standard AAV vectors or via mRNA or as a recombinant protein. Preferably the RELN sequences, when used, are from human RELN. In some embodiments a mini-RELN can include: a signal peptide, RAP, IgG Fc, and C-terminus RELN including the H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation; a signal peptide, IgG Fc, RAP, and C-terminus RELN including the H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation; or a signal peptide, R3-6, and C- terminus RELN including the H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation. In some embodiments, the C-terminus RELN including the H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation, can be longer than 30 amino acids (e.g., R8 to CTR-- amino acids 3051-3460) but is less than the full length reelin, e.g., up to 100, 105, 110, 120, 130, 150, 200, 300, 400, or 410 amino acids. In some embodiments, at the N terminus, the mini-RELN includes a signal peptide from RELN, or a signal peptide from another protein (e.g., IL2 signal peptide, human albumin signal peptide, human alpha 1-antitrypsin signal peptide, or human factor VIII signal peptide, not shown in SEQ ID NO:1 below); a CR-50 Domain (e.g., amino acids 229 to 345 of full length RELN, shown in lower case below); a linker (e.g., as shown in lower case italics); R5-6 of RELN (e.g., amino acids 1918 to 2664); and C-terminus (e.g., amino acids 3429 to 3460, shown in italics, with bold font indicating the position of the H3447R variant). SEQ ID NO:1 is the exemplary 225Z construct; other constructs including those shown herein can also be used. ) Additional exemplary sequences of miniRELN constructs include the following (the key of

LINKER-R5-6 OF RELN-c- terminus reln H3447R In some embodiments, the proteins and nucleic acids used herein are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to a sequence provided herein, so long as they retain desired functionality of the parental sequence. In some embodiments, the proteins can include a sequence provided herein with exactly, at least, or up to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten altered amino acids. Residues that can be changed without destroying function can be identified, e.g., by aligning similar sequences and making conservative substitutions in non- conserved regions (see, e.g., the alignments provided herein). To determine the percent identity of two amino acid sequences, or of two nucleic acid sequences, the sequences are aligned for optimal comparison purposes (e.g., gaps can be introduced in one or both of a first and a second amino acid or nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment and non-homologous sequences can be disregarded for comparison purposes). In some embodiments, the length of a reference sequence aligned for comparison purposes is at least 80% of the length of the reference sequence, and in some embodiments is at least 90% or 100%. The amino acid residues or nucleotides at corresponding amino acid positions or nucleotide positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same amino acid residue or nucleotide as the corresponding position in the second sequence, then the molecules are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical positions shared by the sequences, taking into account the number of gaps, and the length of each gap, which need to be introduced for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The comparison of sequences and determination of percent identity between two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. For example, the percent identity between two amino acid sequences can be determined using the Needleman and Wunsch ((1970) J. Mol. Biol.48:444-453) algorithm which has been incorporated into the GAP program in the GCG software package (available on the world wide web at gcg.com), using the default parameters, e.g., a Blossum 62 scoring matrix with a gap penalty of 12, a gap extend penalty of 4, and a frameshift gap penalty of 5. Increased RELN signaling can also be achieved by increasing activity or expression levels of DAB1 using different approaches including increasing its phosphorylation, decreasing dephosphorylation or increasing dimerization or oligomerization. An exemplary sequence of DAB1 is included here. DAB1 expression may be achieved via mRNA administration. Dimerization of DAB1 may be achieved by expressing a DAB1 fusion to FKBP, and the activity of the protein fusion can be controlled by administration of rapamycin. An exemplary Dab1 dimerising construct protein sequence (Dab1 in bold followed by FKBP) is as follows: An exemplary sequence encoding the Dab1 dimerising construct is provided below in the Examples. RAP clustering can also be used increase reelin signaling; see, e.g., Strasser et al., Mol Cell Biol.2004 Feb;24(3):1378-86. An exemplary sequence of a protein fusion of RAP to IgG2 follows (RAP in bold capital case, linker in capital case italics, igG2 in lower case, linker in capital case, RELN CTR with the H3447R variant in lower case bold) (this corresponds to 225T exemplary sequence): yp The HNEL sequence may be removed to enhance secretion. Also provided herein are nucleic acids encoding the proteins described herein (e.g., mini-reelin and variants described in table A), as well as cells expressing the proteins, and nucleic acids encoding the variants, including vectors such as viral vectors. Gene editing CRISPR-based methods can also be used to increase levels or activity of reelin. For example, CRISPR-Cas9 can be used to introduce a H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation, into a reelin gene of a subject who has one or more wild- type reelin alleles. For example, prime editing (see, e.g., Anzalone et al., Nature volume 576, pages149–157 (2019)) can be used to introduce the alteration, optionally using an ssODN comprising the sequence: crNA, comprising a spacer region having the sequence: In some embodiments, the ssODN includes two mismatches with the wild type RELN gene; the first mismatch restore the mutation H3447R (CAT to CGT), a second, optional mismatch destroys the PAM (NGG) from GGG to GGA, as shown below. Similarly, the ssODN can be designed to restore H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation The Cas9 nuclease from S. pyogenes can be guided via simple base pair complementarity between 17-20 nucleotides of an engineered guide RNA (gRNA), e.g., a single guide RNA or crRNA/tracrRNA pair, and the complementary strand of a target genomic DNA sequence of interest that lies next to a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), e.g., a PAM matching the sequence NGG or NAG (Shen et al., Cell Res (2013); Dicarlo et al., Nucleic Acids Res (2013); Jiang et al., Nat Biotechnol 31, 233- 239 (2013); Jinek et al., Elife 2, e00471 (2013); Hwang et al., Nat Biotechnol 31, 227- 229 (2013); Cong et al., Science 339, 819-823 (2013); Mali et al., Science 339, 823- 826 (2013c); Cho et al., Nat Biotechnol 31, 230-232 (2013); Jinek et al., Science 337, 816-821 (2012)). The engineered CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella 1 (Cpf1, also known as Cas12a) nuclease can also be used, e.g., as described in Zetsche et al., Cell 163, 759-771 (2015); Schunder et al., Int J Med Microbiol 303, 51-60 (2013); Makarova et al., Nat Rev Microbiol 13, 722-736 (2015); Fagerlund et al., Genome Biol 16, 251 (2015). Unlike SpCas9, Cpf1/Cas12a requires only a single 42-nt crRNA, which has 23 nt at its 3’ end that are complementary to the protospacer of the target DNA sequence (Zetsche et al., 2015). Furthermore, whereas SpCas9 recognizes an NGG PAM sequence that is 3’ of the protospacer, AsCpf1 and LbCp1 recognize TTTN PAMs that are found 5’ of the protospacer (Id.). In some embodiments, the present system utilizes a wild type or variant Cas9 protein from S. pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, or a wild type or variant Cpf1 protein from Acidaminococcus sp. BV3L6 or Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 either as encoded in bacteria or codon-optimized for expression in mammalian cells and/or modified in its PAM recognition specificity and/or its genome-wide specificity. A number of variants have been described; see, e.g., WO 2016/141224, PCT/US2016/049147, Kleinstiver et al., Nat Biotechnol.2016 Aug;34(8):869-74; Tsai and Joung, Nat Rev Genet.2016 May;17(5):300-12; Kleinstiver et al., Nature. 2016 Jan 28;529(7587):490-5; Shmakov et al., Mol Cell.2015 Nov 5;60(3):385-97; Kleinstiver et al., Nat Biotechnol.2015 Dec;33(12):1293-1298; Dahlman et al., Nat Biotechnol.2015 Nov;33(11):1159-61; Kleinstiver et al., Nature.2015 Jul 23;523(7561):481-5; Wyvekens et al., Hum Gene Ther.2015 Jul;26(7):425-31; Hwang et al., Methods Mol Biol.2015;1311:317-34; Osborn et al., Hum Gene Ther. 2015 Feb;26(2):114-26; Konermann et al., Nature.2015 Jan 29;517(7536):583-8; Fu et al., Methods Enzymol.2014;546:21-45; and Tsai et al., Nat Biotechnol.2014 Jun;32(6):569-76, inter alia. In some embodiments, TrueCut Cas9 Protein v2 is used. Cas9 and analogs are shown in Table B, and engineered protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) or high-fidelity variants are shown in Table C. TABLE B: List of Exemplary Cas9 or Cas12a Orthologs TABLE C: List of Exemplary High Fidelity and/or PAM-relaxed RGN Orthologs * predicted based on UniRule annotation on the UniProt database. In some embodiments an RGN sequence is modified to include a nuclear localization sequences (NLSs), e.g., at the C- and/or N-terminus of the RGN protein, and a mini-polyadenylation signal (or Poly-A sequence). Exemplary NLSs include SV40 large T antigen NLS (PKKKRRV); PKKKRKV; KRTADGSEFES)PKKKRKV; and nucleoplasmin NLS (KRPAATKKAGQAKKKK). Other NLSs are known in the art; see, e.g., Cokol et al., EMBO Rep.2000 Nov 15; 1(5):411–415; Freitas and Cunha, Curr Genomics. 2009 Dec; 10(8): 550–557. An exemplary polyadenylation signal is Guide RNAs appropriate for the RGN should be used; in some embodiments, the gRNAs used in the present disclosure can be unimolecular or modular, as known in the art. In some embodiments, ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs), or gene therapy vectors or mRNA encoding CRISPR/Cas9 constructs, ssODN, and sgRNA, e.g., the above ssODN and sgRNA, are administered to introduce the H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation in RELN into the whole brain or more specifically into the entorhinal cortex, e.g., using stereotactic injection as described herein. In some embodiments, where the Cas9 protein is administered in a viral vector, the sequence can be split across two vectors (see, e.g., Truong et al., Nucleic Acids Res.2015 Jul 27;43(13):6450-8). Demethylation of the RELN Promoter Methylation of the RELN promoter reduces expression of reelin protein (Chen et al., Nucleic Acids Res.2002 Jul 1;30(13):2930-9. Thus the present methods can include inducing demethylation of the RELN promoter. As one example, CRISPR/Cas-based demethylases, in which a demethylase (e.g., Tet1 catalytic domain (Tet-CD)) is linked to a catalytically inactive (dead) Cas protein (Xu et al., Cell Discovery (2016) 2, 16009), can be used to trigger demethylation of the promoter sequence of RELN to de-repress and therefore increase expression of reelin (57). The promoter sequence of the RELN gene is listed below, with proposed gRNAs for use with dCas9 targeting to regulate methylation. In some embodiments, ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs), gene therapy, or mRNA encoding CRISPR/Cas9 constructs and the above ssODN and sgRNA are administered to introduce the H3447R or H3447K mutation and/or a R3454A mutation, optionally H3447R or H3447K in combination with an R3454A mutation in RELN into the whole brain or more specifically into the entorhinal cortex, e.g., using stereotactic injection as described herein. Other compounds can also be used to reduce methylation of the RELN promoter and thus increase expression of the reelin gene, including administration of hsa_circRNA_102049, which acts as a sponge for hsa-miR-214-3p (Wang et al., Bioengineered.2022 Feb;13(2):2272-2284). Delivery Vectors Nucleic acids encoding a Reelin or CRISPR/cas polypeptide (e.g., wild type, variant, peptide, or fragment thereof) can be incorporated into a gene construct to be used as a part of a gene therapy protocol. For example, described herein are targeted expression vectors for in vivo delivery and expression of a polynucleotide that encodes a Reelin polypeptide or active fragment thereof in particular cell types, especially cerebral cortical neuronal cells. Expression constructs of such components can be administered in any effective carrier, e.g., any formulation or composition capable of effectively delivering the component gene to cells in vivo. Approaches include insertion of the gene in viral vectors, preferably adeno-associated virus. Viral vectors typically transduce cells directly. Viral vectors capable of highly efficient transduction of CNS neurons may be employed, including any serotypes of rAAV (e.g., AAV1-AAV12) vectors, recombinant or chimeric AAV vectors, as well as lentivirus or other suitable viral vectors. In some embodiments, a polynucleotide encoding Reelin is operably linked to promoter suitable for expression in the CNS. For example, a neuron subtype-specific specific promoter, such as the alpha-calcium/calmodulin kinase 2A promoter may be used to target excitatory neurons. Alternatively, a pan neuronal promoter, such as the synapsin I promoter, may be used to drive Reelin expression. Other exemplary promoters include, but are not limited to, a cytomegalovirus (CMV) early enhancer/promoter; a hybrid CMV enhance/chicken β-actin (CBA) promoter; a promoter comprising the CMV early enhancer element, the first exon and first intron of the chicken β-actin gene, and the splice acceptor of the rabbit β-globin gene (commonly call the “CAG promoter”); or a 1.6-kb hybrid promoter composed of a CMV immediate-early enhancer and CBA intron 1/exon 1 (commonly called the CAGGS promoter; Niwa et al. Gene, 108:193-199 (1991)). The CAGGS promoter (Niwa et al., 1991) has been shown to provide ubiquitous and long-term expression in the brain (Klein et al., Exp. Neurol.176:66-74 (2002)).A typical approach for in vivo introduction of nucleic acid into a cell is by use of a viral vector containing nucleic acid, e.g., a cDNA encoding a Reelin. Among other things, infection of cells with a viral vector has the advantage that a large proportion of the targeted cells can receive the nucleic acid. Additionally, molecules encoded within the viral vector, e.g., by a cDNA contained in the viral vector, are expressed efficiently in cells that have taken up viral vector nucleic acid. A viral vector system particularly useful for delivery of nucleic acids is the adeno-associated virus (AAV). Adeno-associated virus is a naturally occurring defective virus that requires another virus, such as an adenovirus or a herpes virus, as a helper virus for efficient replication and a productive life cycle. (For a review see Muzyczka et al., Curr. Topics in Micro and Immunol.158:97-129 (1992)). AAV vectors efficiently transduce various cell types and can produce long-term expression of transgenes in vivo. Although AAV vector genomes can persist within cells as episomes, vector integration has been observed (see for example Deyle and Russell, Curr Opin Mol Ther.2009 Aug; 11(4): 442–447; Asokan et al., Mol Ther.2012 April; 20(4): 699–708; Flotte et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol.7:349-356 (1992); Samulski et al., J. Virol.63:3822-3828 (1989); and McLaughlin et al., J. Virol. 62:1963-1973 (1989)). AAV vectors, such as AAV2, have been extensively used for gene augmentation or replacement and have shown therapeutic efficacy in a range of animal models as well as in the clinic; see, e.g., Mingozzi and High, Nature Reviews Genetics 12, 341-355 (2011); Deyle and Russell, Curr Opin Mol Ther.2009 Aug; 11(4): 442–447; Asokan et al., Mol Ther.2012 April; 20(4): 699–708. AAV vectors containing as little as 300 base pairs of AAV can be packaged and can produce recombinant protein expression. Protocols for producing recombinant retroviruses and for infecting cells in vitro or in vivo with such viruses are known in the art, e.g, can be found in Ausubel, et al., eds., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing Associates, (1989), Sections 9.10-9.14, and other standard laboratory manuals. The use of AAV vectors to deliver constructs for expression in the brain has been described, e.g., in Iwata et al., Sci Rep.2013;3:1472; Hester et al., Curr Gene Ther.2009 Oct;9(5):428-33; Doll et al., Gene Therapy 1996, 3(5):437-447; and Foley et al., J Control Release.2014 Dec 28;196:71-8. Thus, in some embodiments, the Reelin encoding nucleic acid is present in a vector for gene therapy, such as an AAV vector. In some instances, the AAV vector is selected from the group consisting of AAV1, AAV2, AAV3, AAV4, AAV5, AAV6, AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAVrh10, AAV11, and AAV12. A vector as described herein can be a pseudotyped vector. Pseudotyping provides a mechanism for modulating a vector’s target cell population. For instance, pseudotyped AAV vectors can be utilized in various methods described herein. Pseudotyped vectors are those that contain the genome of one vector, e.g., the genome of one AAV serotype, in the capsid of a second vector, e.g., a second AAV serotype. Methods of pseudotyping are well known in the art. For instance, a vector may be pseudotyped with envelope glycoproteins derived from Rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotypes (Indiana and Chandipura strains), rabies virus (e.g., various Evelyn–Rokitnicki–Abelseth ERA strains and challenge virus standard (CVS)), Lyssavirus Mokola virus, a rabies-related virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Mokola virus (MV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), rabies virus glycoprotein (RV-G), glycoprotein B type (FuG-B), a variant of FuG-B (FuG- B2) or Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). A virus may be pseudotyped for transduction of one or more neurons or groups of cells. In addition, the capsid can be altered to include one or more peptides that increase expression in the CNS, see, e.g., Yao et al., Nat Biomed Eng.2022 Oct 10; Chatterjee et al., Gene Ther.2022 Jun;29(6):390-397; Meng et al., Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev.2021 Feb 27;21:28-41; Zhang et al., Biomaterials.2022 Feb;281:121340; Gray, Cell Gene Ther. Insights 5, 1361–1368 (2019); Nonnenmacher et al., Mol. Ther. Methods Clin. Dev.20, 366–378 (2021). Without limitation, illustrative examples of pseudotyped vectors include recombinant AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/5, AAV2/6, AAV2/7, AAV2/8, AAV9, AAVrh10, AAV11, and AAV12 serotype vectors. It is known in the art that such vectors may be engineered to include a transgene encoding a human protein or other protein. In particular instances, the present disclosures can include a pseudotyped AAV9 or AAVrh10 viral vector including a nucleic acid as disclosed herein. See Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy: Methods and Protocols, ed. Machida, Humana Press, 2003. In some instances, a particular AAV serotype vector may be selected based upon the intended use, e.g., based upon the intended route of administration. Various methods for application of AAV vector constructs in gene therapy are known in the art, including methods of modification, purification, and preparation for administration to human subjects (see, e.g., Viral Vectors for Gene Therapy: Methods and Protocols, ed. Machida, Humana Press, 2003). In addition, AAV based gene therapy targeted to cells of the CNS has been described (see, e.g., U.S. patents 6,180,613 and 6,503,888). High titer AAV preparations can be produced using techniques known in the art, e.g., as described in U.S. Pat. No.5,658,776 A vector construct refers to a polynucleotide molecule including all or a portion of a viral genome and a transgene. In some instances, gene transfer can be mediated by a DNA viral vector, such as an adenovirus (Ad) or adeno-associated virus (AAV). Other vectors useful in methods of gene therapy are known in the art. For example, a construct as disclosed herein can include an alphavirus, herpesvirus, retrovirus, lentivirus, or vaccinia virus. Adenoviruses are a relatively well characterized group of viruses, including over 50 serotypes (see, e.g., WO 95/27071, which is herein incorporated by reference). Adenoviruses are tractable through the application of techniques of molecular biology and may not require integration into the host cell genome. Recombinant Ad-derived vectors, including vectors that reduce the potential for recombination and generation of wild-type virus, have been constructed (see, e.g., international patent publications WO 95/00655 and WO 95/11984, which are herein incorporated by reference). Wild-type AAV has high infectivity and is capable of integrating into a host genome with a high degree of specificity (see, e.g., Hermonat and Muzyczka 1984 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 81:6466-6470 and Lebkowski et al. 1988 Mol. Cell. Biol.8:3988-3996). Non-native regulatory sequences, gene control sequences, promoters, non- coding sequences, introns, or coding sequences can be included in a nucleic acid as disclosed herein. The inclusion of nucleic acid tags or signaling sequences, or nucleic acids encoding protein tags or protein signaling sequences, is further contemplated herein. Typically, the coding region is operably linked with one or more regulatory nucleic acid components. A promoter included in a nucleic acid as disclosed herein can be a tissue- or cell type-specific promoter, a promoter specific to multiple tissues or cell types, an organ-specific promoter, a promoter specific to multiple organs, a systemic or ubiquitous promoter, or a nearly systemic or ubiquitous promoter. Promoters having stochastic expression, inducible expression, conditional expression, or otherwise discontinuous, inconstant, or unpredictable expression are also included within the scope of the present disclosure. A promoter can include any of the above characteristics or other promoter characteristics known in the art. In clinical settings, the gene delivery systems for the therapeutic gene can be introduced into a subject by any of a number of methods, each of which is familiar in the art. For instance, a pharmaceutical preparation of the gene delivery system can be introduced systemically, e.g., by intravenous injection, and specific transduction of the protein in the target cells will occur predominantly from specificity of transfection, provided by the gene delivery vehicle, cell-type or tissue-type expression due to the transcriptional regulatory sequences controlling expression of the receptor gene, or a combination thereof. In other embodiments, initial delivery of the recombinant gene is more limited, with introduction into the subject being quite localized. For example, the gene delivery vehicle can be introduced by catheter (see U.S. Patent 5,328,470) or by stereotactic injection, e.g., optionally into the cisterna magna, cerebral ventricles, lumbar intrathecal space, direct injection into hippocampus (e.g., Chen et al., PNAS USA 91: 3054-3057 (1994)) and/or the entorhinal cortex. In some embodiments, delivery methods of reelin-expressing virus include intravenous, intrathecal, intracerebroventricular, intracisternal, and stereotactic intraparenchymal administration. The pharmaceutical preparation of the gene therapy construct can consist essentially of the gene delivery system in an acceptable diluent, or can comprise a slow release matrix in which the gene delivery vehicle is embedded. Alternatively, where the complete gene delivery system can be produced intact from recombinant cells, e.g., retroviral vectors, the pharmaceutical preparation can comprise one or more cells, which produce the gene delivery system. Reelin Formulations and Pharmaceutical Compositions In some embodiments, the reelin polynucleotides as disclosed herein for delivery to a target tissue in vivo are encapsulated or associated with in a nanoparticle. Methods for nanoparticle packaging are well known in the art, and are described, for example, in Bose S, et al (Role of Nucleolin in Human Parainfluenza Virus Type 3 Infection of Human Lung Epithelial Cells. J. Virol.78:8146.2004); Dong Y et al. Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)/montmorillonite nanoparticles for oral delivery of anticancer drugs. Biomaterials 26:6068.2005); Lobenberg R. et al (Improved body distribution of 14C-labelled AZT bound to nanoparticles in rats determined by radioluminography. J Drug Target 5:171.1998); Sakuma S R et al (Mucoadhesion of polystyrene nanoparticles having surface hydrophilic polymeric chains in the gastrointestinal tract. Int J Pharm 177:161.1999); Virovic L et al. Novel delivery methods for treatment of viral hepatitis: an update. Expert Opin Drug Deliv 2:707.2005); and Zimmermann E et al, Electrolyte- and pH-stabilities of aqueous solid lipid nanoparticle (SLN) dispersions in artificial gastrointestinal media. Eur J Pharm Biopharm 52:203.2001). In some embodiments, one or more polynucleotides is delivered to a target tissue in vivo in a vesicle, e.g. a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al., in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez-Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Liss, New York, pp.353-365 (1989); Lopez-Berestein, ibid., pp.317-327; see generally ibid). In some embodiments, lipid- based nanoparticles (LNP) are used; see, e.g., Robinson et al., Mol Ther.2018 Aug 1;26(8):2034-2046; US9956271B2. The present methods and compositions can include microvesicles or a preparation thereof that contains one or more therapeutic molecules, e.g., polynucleotides or RNA, as described herein. “Microvesicles”, as the term is used herein, refers to membrane-derived microvesicles, which includes a range of extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, microparticles and shed microvesicles secreted by many cell types under both normal physiological and pathological conditions. See, e.g., EP2010663B1. The methods and compositions described herein can be applied to microvesicles of all sizes. In some embodiments, 30 to 200 nm, In some embodiments, 30 to 800 nm, In some embodiments, up to 2 um. The methods and compositions described herein can also be more broadly applied to all extracellular vesicles, a term which encompasses exosomes, shed microvesicles, oncosomes, ectosomes, and retroviral-like particles. Such a microvesicle or preparation is produced by the herein described methods. As the term is used herein, a microvesicle preparation refers to a population of microvesicles obtained/prepared from the same cellular source. Such a preparation is generated, for example, in vitro, by culturing cells expressing the nucleic acid molecule of the instant invention and isolating microvesicles produced by the cells. Methods of isolating such microvesicles are known in the art (Thery et al., Isolation and characterization of exosomes from cell culture supernatants and biological fluids, in Current Protocols Cell Biology, Chapter 3, 322, (John Wiley, 2006); Palmisano et al., (Mol Cell Proteomics.2012 August; 11(8):230-43) and Waldenström et al., ((2012) PLoS ONE 7(4): e34653)), some examples of which are described herein. Such techniques for isolating microvesicles from cells in culture include, without limitation, sucrose gradient purification/separation and differential centrifugation, and can be adapted for use in a method or composition described herein. See, e.g., EP2010663B1. In some embodiments, the microvesicles are isolated by gentle centrifugation (e.g., at about 300 g) of the culture medium of the donor cells for a period of time adequate to separate cells from the medium (e.g., about 15 minutes). This leaves the microvesicles in the supernatant, to thereby yield the microvesicle preparation. In some embodiments, the culture medium or the supernatant from the gentle centrifugation, is more strongly centrifuged (e.g., at about 16,000 g) for a period of time adequate to precipitate cellular debris (e.g., about 30 minutes). This leaves the microvesicles in the supernatant, to thereby yield the microvesicle preparation. In some embodiments, the culture medium, the gentle centrifuged preparation, or the strongly centrifuged preparation is subjected to filtration (e.g., through a 0.22 um filter or a 0.8 um filter, whereby the microvesicles pass through the filter. In some embodiments, the filtrate is subjected to a final ultracentrifugation (e.g. at about 110,000 g) for a period of time that will adequately precipitate the microvesicles (e.g. for about 80 minutes). The resulting pellet contains the microvesicles and can be resuspended in a volume of buffer that yields a useful concentration for further use, to thereby yield the microvesicle preparation. In some embodiments, the microvesicle preparation is produced by sucrose density gradient purification. In some embodiments, the microvesicles are further treated with DNAse (e.g., DNAse I) and/or RNAse and/or proteinase to eliminate any contaminating DNA, RNA, or protein, respectively, from the exterior. In some embodiments, the microvesicle preparation contains one or more RNAse inhibitors. The molecules contained within the microvesicle preparation will comprise the therapeutic molecule. Typically the microvesicles in a preparation will be a heterogeneous population, and each microvesicle will contain a complement of molecule that may or may not differ from that of other microvesicles in the preparation. The content of the therapeutic molecules in a microvesicle preparation can be expressed either quantitatively or qualitatively. One such method is to express the content as the percentage of total molecules within the microvesicle preparation. By way of example, if the therapeutic molecule is an mRNA, the content can be expressed as the percentage of total RNA content, or alternatively as the percentage of total mRNA content, of the microvesicle preparation. Similarly, if the therapeutic molecule is a protein, the content can be expressed as the percentage of total protein within the microvesicles. In some embodiments, therapeutic microvesicles, or a preparation thereof, produced by the method described herein contain a detectable, statistically significantly increased amount of the therapeutic molecule as compared to microvesicles obtained from control cells (cells obtained from the same source which have not undergone scientific manipulation to increase expression of the therapeutic molecule). In some embodiments, the therapeutic molecule is present in an amount that is at least about 10%, 20%, 30% 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% 80% or 90%, more than in microvesicles obtained from control cells. Higher levels of enrichment may also be achieved. In some embodiments, the therapeutic molecule is present in the microvesicle or preparation thereof, at least 2 fold more than control cell microvesicles. Higher fold enrichment may also be obtained (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 fold). In some embodiments, a relatively high percentage of the microvesicle content is the therapeutic molecule (e.g., achieved through overexpression or specific targeting of the molecule to microvesicles). In some embodiments, the microvesicle content of the therapeutic molecule is at least about 10%, 20%, 30% 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% 80% or 90%, of the total (like) molecule content (e.g., the therapeutic molecule is an mRNA and is about 10% of the total mRNA content of the microvesicle). Higher levels of enrichment may also be achieved. In some embodiments, the therapeutic molecule is present in the microvesicle or preparation thereof, at least 2 fold more than all other such (like) molecules. Higher fold enrichment may also be obtained (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 fold). Reelin CTR Initial assessment of the Reelin CTR sequence indicated that the sequence is highly conserved across mammalian species, suggesting that previously uncharacterized Reelin CTR may play an important neurobiological role (11). We show that AA in position 3447 is aligned on the same side as other arginines in a known heparin-binding motif. Therefore, a basic AA in this position has the potential to contribute to HSPG interactions (FIG.9). Building on this initial result, we used NMR to elucidate the previously unknown structure of the Reelin CTR (FIG.10). We find that the Reelin CTR is primarily an alpha-helical structure with the last 16 AAs having increased flexibility. Here, increased flexibility in the secondary structure may indicate a potential binding site. Additionally, a basic AA in position 3447 favored heparin interaction as observed by HPLC. H3447R Reelin has a significantly later peak retention time in comparison to R3446H or WT peptides across two different experimental designs. We considered significant differences in peak retention times to be at least greater than 30 seconds. An acidic AA (H3447D) had significantly less interaction in comparison to neutral (WT) or basic AAs (H3447R, H3447K). In sum, the Reelin CTR has a charge- based interaction with heparin, and the 3447 position plays a role in these interactions. To gain further insights into the kinetics of this interaction, heparin – Reelin CTR peptide interaction was assessed using SPR. H3447R Reelin had ~2-fold more interaction with heparin as compared to Reelin WT peptide (FIGs.12A-B); to verify this small difference, we additionally assessed this interaction using BLI and found the same difference with fc-fusion peptides (FIG.13). In this case, the fc-fusion peptides are likely to be short due to the method of production. Therefore, using two different methods, we find that H3447R has 2-fold more interaction in comparison to WT Reelin. We then used ITC to further understand the thermodynamic properties of this interaction and found that H3447R is favored to interact, especially in vivo. Nonetheless, we also found that with long peptides, the Ka, ΔH, and ΔG, and ΔS were similar. This may partially be explained because this method assess binding in solution whereas the kinetic and HPLC methods assess binding with heparin attached to a surface; therefore, the configuration of the Reelin peptide and potential binding site exposure may be affected. Significantly, the short peptides showed more positive entropy and more negative Gibbs free energy in comparison to the Reelin WT short variant. Since the Reelin CTR is normally cleaved by furin, the short peptide is the most representative in vivo variant. Therefore, H3447R Reelin – HSPG interactions may be thermodynamically favored in comparison to WT Reelin in vivo. Additionally, the negative controls for ITC showed that basic amino acids in the 3446-3447 position play a significant role in heparin interaction, and there is ~100x less affinity without at least 1 basic amino acid in the binding site. We also found that H3447R has 10-fold more interaction with NRP1 in comparison to WT fc-fusion peptides. This experiment suggests the Reelin CTR may have additional interactions at the cell surface. Overall, these data indicate that H3447R has increased interaction with heparin in comparison to WT. Without wishing to be bound by theory, Reelin first binds to HSPGs and subsequently LDL receptors or other receptors, where the Reelin CTR interacts with HSPGs and the Reelin intermediate domain interacts with LDL receptors. These cell surface interactions may eventually modulate downstream NFT formation since it has previously been shown that dysregulation of Reelin may lead to tau hyperphosphorylation (43, 44). Significantly, RELN CTR decreased amyloid aggregation, suggesting a role in the progression of AD pathology (FIG.14A. However, mutations in position 3447 including the Reelin-COLBOS variant H3447R did not significantly affect Aβ aggregation compared to WT, though there was a trend towards higher reduction. The patient described herein who was resilient to ADAD had high levels of amyloid plaque burden. These results indicate that the flexibility of the N-terminal region may play a role in the seeding of Aβ, since H is less flexible than R or K amino acids (45). Furthermore, the relative flexibility of the alpha – GAG binding site may help against propagation of Aβ plaques (FIGs.14A-B). In contrast, our results show the beta – GAG site interacts with GAGs and NRP1, and the H3447R mutation optimizes these interactions (FIGs.11A-D, 12A-B, 13). The RELN CTR may have multiple interaction partners including GAGs, NRP1, amyloid, and potentially others. The RELN H3447R mutation found in the AD-protected case is clearly not neutral and may contribute to the AD-protection phenotype via multiple mechanisms. We show that the RELN CTR–GAG interaction is reproducible across various methods, and the H3447R mutation enhances a binding site that may impact interactions with other multiple molecules relevant to neurodegenerative diseases. Provided herein are compositions comprising RELN CTR peptides. These peptides can comprise or consisting of the RELN-CTR wild type (WT) or RELN- CTR H3447R/K variant peptide (preferably H3447R: RKQNYMMNFSRQHGLRRFYNRRRRSLRRYP). In some embodiments, the CTR peptides are variants that can include one or more alternative or additional mutations as described herein, e.g., as shown in Table 1, and/or a mutation at G3444, e.g., G3444H or G3444P. Table 1. Exemplary Reelin CTR peptide properties In some embodiments, the Reelin CTR peptides are at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical to a sequence provided herein, so long as they retain desired functionality of the parental sequence. In some embodiments, the peptides can include a sequence provided herein with exactly, at least, or up to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten altered amino acids. Also provided are compositions comprising the CTR peptides, optionally in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and optionally mixed with a non-reelin protein or nucleic acid. The nucleic acid can be, e.g., an mRNA encoding a therapeutic or prophylactic agent such as an antigen for a vaccine. The CTR peptides can also be in a fusion protein with a non-reelin sequence, e.g., wherein the CTR peptide sequence is at the N terminus, C terminus, or inserted internally at a position that doesn’t affect function of the non-reelin sequence. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Methods of Administration The methods described herein include the use of pharmaceutical compositions comprising or consisting of a therapeutic agent described herein, e.g., a Reelin protein or fragment thereof, e.g., a mini-Reelin; or a nucleic acid encoding the same, as described herein, as an active ingredient. Pharmaceutical compositions typically include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” includes saline, solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be incorporated into the compositions, e.g., a mRNA encoding a therapeutic or diagnostic protein. Pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to be compatible with its intended route of administration. Examples of routes of administration include parenteral, e.g., intravenous, intradermal, subcutaneous, oral (e.g., inhalation), transdermal (topical), transmucosal, and rectal administration. In some embodiments, the composition is delivered to the brain, e.g., by administration into the cisterna magna, cerebral ventricles, lumbar intrathecal space, direct injection into hippocampus (e.g., Chen et al., PNAS USA 91: 3054-3057 (1994)). In some embodiments, delivery methods of reelin-expressing virus include intravenous, intrathecal, intracerebroventricular, intracisternal, and stereotactic intraparenchymal administration. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered in or around the entorhinal cortex of the brain. Methods of formulating suitable pharmaceutical compositions are known in the art, see, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st ed., 2005; and the books in the series Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences: a Series of Textbooks and Monographs (Dekker, NY). For example, solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use can include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water, Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all cases, the composition must be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle, which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound can be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g., gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. For administration by inhalation, the compounds can be delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressured container or dispenser that contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a nebulizer. Such methods include those described in U.S. Patent No.6,468,798. Systemic administration of a therapeutic compound as described herein can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art, and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the active compounds are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or creams as generally known in the art. The pharmaceutical compositions can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention enemas for rectal delivery. Therapeutic compounds that are or include nucleic acids can be administered by any method suitable for administration of nucleic acid agents, such as a DNA vaccine. These methods include gene guns, bio injectors, and skin patches as well as needle-free methods such as the micro-particle DNA vaccine technology disclosed in U.S. Patent No.6,194,389, and the mammalian transdermal needle-free vaccination with powder-form vaccine as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.6,168,587. Additionally, intranasal delivery is possible, as described in, inter alia, Hamajima et al., Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol., 88(2), 205-10 (1998). Liposomes (e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No.6,472,375) and microencapsulation can also be used. Biodegradable targetable microparticle delivery systems can also be used (e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No.6,471,996). In one embodiment, the therapeutic compounds are prepared with carriers that will protect the therapeutic compounds against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Such formulations can be prepared using standard techniques, or obtained commercially, e.g., from Alza Corporation and Nova Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to selected cells with monoclonal antibodies to cellular antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No.4,522,811. The pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or dispenser together with instructions for administration. Ocular administration can be achieved via intravitreal or subretinal injection of biologics including protein, nucleic acids or vectors including viruses or via electroporation of DNA plasmids in the ciliary body. Methods of Determining Risk of Developing AD Included herein are methods for determining risk of identifying AD in a subject, e.g., a human subject. The methods rely on detection of the H3447R variant of the RELN gene in the subject’s DNA. The methods include obtaining a sample comprising genomic DNA from a subject and evaluating the presence of the H3447R variant in the sample. As used herein the term “sample”, when referring to the material to be tested for the presence of the H3447R variant, includes inter alia tissue (including buccal cells from a swab) or blood. Various methods are well known within the art for the identification and/or isolation and/or purification of genomic DNA from a sample. For example, nucleic acids contained in the sample can be first isolated according to standard methods, for example using lytic enzymes, chemical solutions, or isolated by nucleic acid-binding resins following the manufacturer’s instructions. The presence and/or level of a H3447R variant nucleic acid can be evaluated using methods known in the art, e.g., using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative or semi-quantitative real-time RT-PCR, digital PCR i.e. BEAMing ((Beads, Emulsion, Amplification, Magnetics) Diehl (2006) Nat Methods 3:551-559); RNAse protection assay; Northern blot; various types of nucleic acid sequencing (Sanger, pyrosequencing, NextGeneration Sequencing); or gene array/chips) (Lehninger Biochemistry (Worth Publishers, Inc., current addition; Sambrook, et al, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual (3. Sup.rd Edition, 2001); Bernard (2002) Clin Chem 48(8): 1178-1185; Miranda (2010) Kidney International 78:191-199; Bianchi (2011) EMBO Mol Med 3:495-503; Taylor (2013) Front. Genet.4:142; Yang (2014) PLOS One 9(11):e110641); Nordstrom (2000) Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem.31(2):107-112; Ahmadian (2000) Anal Biochem 280:103-110. In some embodiments, high throughput methods, e.g., protein or gene chips as are known in the art (see, e.g., Ch. 12, Genomics, in Griffiths et al., Eds. Modern genetic Analysis, 1999,W. H. Freeman and Company; Ekins and Chu, Trends in Biotechnology, 1999, 17:217-218; MacBeath and Schreiber, Science 2000, 289(5485):1760-1763; Simpson, Proteins and Proteomics: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; 2002; Hardiman, Microarrays Methods and Applications: Nuts & Bolts, DNA Press, 2003), can be used to detect the presence of the H3447R variant. In some embodiments a technique suitable for the detection of alterations in the structure or sequence of nucleic acids, such as the presence of deletions, amplifications, or substitutions, can be used for the detection of the H3447R variant. Gene arrays can be prepared by selecting probes that comprise the H3447R variant polynucleotide sequence, and then immobilizing such probes to a solid support or surface. For example, the probes may comprise DNA sequences, RNA sequences, co-polymer sequences of DNA and RNA, DNA and/or RNA analogues, or combinations thereof. The probe sequences can be synthesized either enzymatically in vivo, enzymatically in vitro (e.g., by PCR), or non-enzymatically in vitro. A subject who has the H3447R variant in their genome can be identified as having a lower risk of developing AD as compared to a subject who does not have the H3447R variant. In some embodiments, the subject has, or is also identified as having, a APOE4 variant allele. EXAMPLES The invention is further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims. Example 1. Resilience to autosomal dominant Alzheimer’s disease in a Reelin-COLBOS (H3447R) variant carrier Methods The following methods and materials were used in this Example 1. Clinical assessments The patient was evaluated after providing informed written consent approved by the institutional review board of the University of Antioquia and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Brain Imaging We used Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and Flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) to image cerebral Aβ and tau burden, respectively, in vivo. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and both PET scans were conducted at MGH. The 18F-fludeoxyglucose PET was performed at the University of Antioquia and the procedures and data analyses were performed as previously described (2). Genetic and molecular studies We conducted whole exome, whole genome sequencing (WGS), and Genomizer analysis (v10.10) of the subject to obtain a ranking of AD-related potential risk factors as previously shown (2) and as described in detail below. Mouse model We generated a knock-in mouse model carrying the RELN-COLBOS variant via homologous recombination as fee-for-service (Cyagen). Additional details about mouse model and in vivo analyses are described in the methods section of the supplementary appendix. Neuropathology Postmortem interval was 210 minutes after death, brain weight 745 ^4 grams. Following five days of fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde and sample preparation in paraffin, three μm thick sections from specified brain regions were cut, deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or processed for immunohistochemical staining using antibodies as described in the additional neuropathological characterization section. Additional Plasma Nfl Assay Details Plasma neurofilament light (NfL) analysis was conducted by the Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory at Sahlgrenska University Hospital (Mölndal, Sweden) as previously reported (1). The experimenter was masked to clinical or genetic data of the proband, to avoid any bias. Additional genome sequencing details Whole genome sequencing analysis called 44 million variants from the case’s genome. The variants went through multiple filters using Genomiser: population allele frequency <=2%, variant effect filter that exclude intergenic, untranslated regions (UTR), and non-coding intronic regions, regulatory feature filter removes all non-regulatory, non-coding variants over 20 Kb from a known gene, and hiPhive prioritizer phenotype gene priority score >=0 ^401.6,779 variants passed filtering and were ranked by the composite Exomiser scores from gene-phenotype scores and variant pathogenicity scores, and the compatibility with the mode of inheritance. The top three ranked variants were manually reviewed for pathogenicity. We also manually searched a list of 23 genes previously associated to Alzheimer’s including AAGAB, ABCC8, AKT2, APOE, APP, BEAN1, GATA1, GCK, HMGA1, HNF1B, HNF4A, LDB3, PAX4, PSEN1, PSEN2, ABCA7, SORL1 CACNA1G, HFE, MPO, NOS3, and PLAU. The gene variants from WGS were extracted and annotated in the Alissa Interpret platform for independent pathogenicity interpretation (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). We calculated “C scores” using Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion CADD (2, 3), to contrast pathogenicity of human-derived vs. simulated variants. The regulatory Mendelian mutation (ReMM) framework uses machine learning techniques to train a classifier to predict the potential of an arbitrary position in the non-coding genome to cause a Mendelian disease if mutated (4). Additional single cell RNA sequencing details We used a Ficoll gradient to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells and these cells were analyzed by scRNA sequencing using a protocol previously published (1). Additional RELN genotyping by Sanger DNA sequencing details The DNA was first extracted using Gentra Puregene Kit (Qiagen).50 ^L of the obtained samples (both RELN H3447R and RELN H3447 carriers) were amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using one ^L of ten ^M primers (forward:5’- GTCCCAGCCTTTAGTTCCT-3’; reverse: 3’- CAACTTTCACGGACACATCAA-5’) pre-mixed in PCR Master Mix 2X (K0171, Thermo Fisher) using the following protocol: three minutes at 94 ºC for initial denaturation, 33 cycles, 30 seconds at 94 ºC, 35 seconds at 62 ºC for annealing, 35 seconds at 72 ºC for the elongation, five minutes at 72 ºC for final extension. Horizontal electrophoresis was done at 100 V using 1 ^5% Agarose gel in TAE buffer (Tris-acetate EDTA, T8280-1L, Sigma Aldrich) and mixed with GelRed (41003-T, Biotium). Fluorescence of positive bands was detected via Bio-RAD Molecular Imager Gel Doc XR+ and acquired via Image Lab software (ver.6.0.1, Biorad). Purification of the amplified DNA was done using QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and sequenced by MGH CCIB DNA core using the 3730xl sequencer (Applied Biosystems) as previously published(1). Additional Cell Culture Details Plasmid encoding for full-length murine recombinant RELN was a gift from Dr. Tom Curran via Addgene (plasmid #122444(5)). The plasmid was subsequently mutagenized to obtain the H3448R mutation homologous of human RELN H3447R as fee-for-service by CustomDNAConstructs (New York, USA). We produced WT and RELN-COLBOS in Flp-In T-Rex 293 mammalian cells (R78007, Thermo Fisher Scientific) via transient transfection and used them for receptor binding assays via ELISA. Plasmids encoding for the CTR-RELN-Fc fused peptides were obtained from CustomDNAConstructs as fee-for-service. All constructs were overexpressed in Flp- In T-Rex 293 mammalian cells (R78007, Thermo Fisher Scientific) via transient transfection using lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer (11668030, Thermo Fisher). Five hours post-transfection, Opti-MEM was used to collect conditioned media. Cells were incubated for 24 hours, and supernatant was collected and cleared from cell debris by centrifugation for three minutes, 1,800 rcf at room temperature (R.T.). Primary CD1 brain cortex mouse neurons (M-CX-400, Lonza) were cultured in neurobasal media (Gibco) supplemented with B-27 (Thermo Fisher), glutamax (Gibco) and normocin (Invivogen). Cells were plated on poly-L-lysine (Sigma) coated wells and treated at day six post-liquid nitrogen recovery. Treatments with recombinant RELN (RELN WT or RELN H3448R, four µg/mL) were incubated for either five minutes or one hour at 37ºC, 5% CO2 in the presence of ten µM Mg-132 (ab141003, Abcam). Cells were washed in ice cold dPBS (Gibco) and lysed in RIPA (9806, Cell Signaling) supplemented with ten µM Mg-132, Triton-X100 (Sigma Aldrich), proteases inhibitor cocktail (4693159001, Millipore) and phosphatases inhibitors (4906837001, Sigma Aldrich, and P0044, Millipore). Protein concentration was determined by Pierce Bicinchonic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (23227, Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were prepared containing ten µL Laemmli buffer (Boston Bioproducts) and four µL of one M DTT (Sigma Aldrich) and diluted to a final volume of 40 µL with water and denatured five min at 90 °C. Additional Western Blotting Details Twenty µg of total cell lysates were prepared in four µL one M 1,4- dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma Aldrich) and ten µL Laemmli buffer (Boston Bioproducts) to a final volume of 40 µL and denatured by heat for five min. at 90 °C. Samples were separated electrophoretically for one h at 90 V using 4–20% pre-cast gradient gels (Mini-PROTEAN TGX, Bio-Rad) and SDS-Tris-Glycine buffer (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to 0 ^45 μm nitrocellulose membranes for one h at 90 V in ice-cold 20% Methanol Tris-Glycine buffer (Bio-Rad). To detect pDAB1 levels, proteins were transferred on PVDF membranes using the iBlot2 dry transfer system (IB21002S, Thermo Fisher). Total protein levels were detected using Licor Membranes were blocked for one h with Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) or for two h with five % dry milk (M17200-100.0, RPI), and both proteases and phosphatases inhibitor cocktails when blocked for anti pDAB1 western blotting. β-Tubulin (ms; 1:2,000; 86298S, Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-Dab1 (Rb; 1:7,500; MBS8511213, MyBiorsorce), total tau (ms, 1:1,000, ab80579, Abcam), phosphorylated tau (Ser396, rb, 1:1,000, 44-752G, Thermo Fisher) and anti RELN antibody (ms, 1:1,000, clone CR-50, D223-3, MBL) were used as primary antibodies and incubated in blocking buffer for either two h at room temperature or 18 h at four °C. After washing the blots for three times with TBS-T buffer (Pierce, Thermo Fisher), secondary antibodies were incubated either one h or 45 minutes at R.T. (IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse, 925- 32212, or IRDye 680CW donkey anti-rb; 1:10,000, 925-68073, Li-COR). Immunoreactive bands were detected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and visualized on the Image Studio software (version 2.1, LI-COR Biosciences). Detection of Dab1 was obtained with anti-rb-HRP conjugated antibody (HAF008, R&D Systems) followed by five minutes incubation with West pico Super Signal™ West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate and acquisition on SyngeneG:Box Digital ECL detection system. Additional Heparin-sepharose affinity chromatography Details We tested changes in binding to heparin of RELN variants chromatographically using an optimized version of a protocol previously published by our laboratory (1). Briefly, after equilibration of the heparin column (BioVision 6554-1) at R.T., columns were washed with five volumes of degassed 20 mM TRIS- HCl buffer (pH 7 ^5). Recombinant C-terminus RELN peptides were produced and purified by Innovagen (Sweden): (WT) RKQNYMMNFSRQHGLRHFYNRRRRSLRRYP, and (H3447R) RKQNYMMNFSRQHGLRRFYNRRRRSLRRYP. One mL of 50 μg/mL peptide (H3447 or WT, and H3447R) was recycled through the column five times and the last flow through collected for further analysis. The column was washed five times with the same buffer and the protein eluted using a 0 ^05 M step gradient of NaCl in 20 mM Tris-HCl (0-1M, one mL per fraction). To ensure the complete release of the protein, the column was washed with five M NaCl 20 mM Tris-HCl. Three independent experiments were conducted for C-terminus RELN WT and H3447R. All eluted fractions were analyzed spectroscopically by reading the absorbance at 280 nm using Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer. Blank corrected fractions were subsequently analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8. Additional ELISA Details Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify changes in binding of RELN variants (media-derived full-length or CTR-RELN) to either VLDLr or ApoEr2 following an optimized version of a previously published protocol (6). Briefly, ELISA strips (DY008, R&D Systems) were coated with one ng/μL (100 μL/well) of VLDLr (8444-VL, R&D) or ApoEr2 (TP320903, OriGene) receptors diluted in 25 mM Tris HCl, 140 mM NaCl, 27 mM KCl, two mM CaCl2, pH 7 ^4 (TBS-C buffer). After 18 h at four ^C incubation, plates were blocked one h with three % BSA (22070008-6, Bioworld), 0 ^05% Tween-20 (Sigma Aldrich) TBS-C buffer. We assessed binding via incubation with 100 μL/well of serial dilutions of recombinant RELN protein (Ser1221-Gln2666, 8546-MR-050, R&D) or RELN variants in TBS-C buffer for one hour at room temperature. For detection, we used goat anti-mouse RELN primary antibody (LS-C793521-100, LS-Bio, 1:2,000, 100 μL/well) as primary antibody for one h at R.T. and (1:10,000; 100 μL/well, donkey anti-goat IgG H&L, HRP, ab6885, Abcam) as secondary antibody for 30 min. at R.T. Between each of the previous steps, plates were washed four times with TBS-C buffer (200 μL/well). Plates were washed three times prior to initiating the colorimetric reaction (DY008, R&D Systems). Stop solution (50 μL/well, DY008, R&D Systems) was added upon five min. incubation and the absorbance of the samples was measured at 450 nm using the Synergy 2 microplate reader (BioTek Instruments). Processing and analysis of the data was done using Gen51.11 software and GraphPad Prism, respectively. Additional SPR Assay Details Surface plasmon resonance assay (SPR) was used for performing binding kinetics using a Biacore 3000 Instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25 ^C following previously published protocols (724) as fee-for-service by Precision Antibody (Maryland, USA). Biotin-labeled heparin (B9806, Sigma Aldrich) was covalently linked to streptavidin-coated chip and unoccupied sites were blocked with biocytin. Antigen was flowed over the chip using a range of single analyte concentrations prepared in DPBS buffer and using a flow rate of 30 μL/min. Binding of antigen to the ligand was monitored in real time to obtain on (ka) and off (kd) rates. The equilibrium constant (KD) was calculated from the observed ka and kd. Accuracy of the SPR analysis was determined via Chi square ( ^2) analysis as described in the statistical analysis section. We included in the analyses the WT and H3447R peptides and peptides with the hypothetical H3447D change (RKQNYMMNFSRQHGLRDFYNRRRRSLRRYP) and the H3447K change (RKQNYMMNFSRQHGLRKFYNRRRRSLRRYP), also produced and purified by Innovagen (Sweden). Additional mouse model and in vivo analyses Details We generated the RELNH3448R-Tg knock in (KI) mouse model at TACONIC by introducing the H3448R (CAC to CGT) mutation into exon 64 in 3’ homology arm of the RELN gene. Gene targeting was obtained using C57BL/6 ES cells. KI mice were generated upon injecting targeted ES cells into the blastocysts that were introduced into the foster mothers for generating the mouse crossings. Mice were euthanized using chambers saturated with CO2. Cerebella were dissected and stored at -80 °C upon cervical dislocation and ensuring a postmortem interval less than three minutes. All procedures were conducted using protocols approved by institutional animal care and Mass Eye and Ear committee. Brain homogenates from dissected cerebella were obtained in modified RIPA buffer (Cell signaling) supplemented with protease (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) and using a tissue homogenizer (two times 15” pulses). Homogenized tissue was then vortexed 20” every 10 min. for one hour and centrifuged ten min.10,000 rpm four °C. Soluble protein fraction was then analyzed using BCA assay (Pierce We measured via western blotting levels of RELN (clone CR-50, D223-3, MBL), Dab1 (clone G-5, sc-271136, Santa Cruz), phospho-Dab1 (Tyr232, MBS8511213, My Biosource), in the cerebellum of adult male and female mice (six to 12 months, n=3-4 per genotype) either wild type, heterozygous or homozygous for the RELN H3448R mutation. Additional Neuropathological Characterization Details Postmortem interval of brain tissue was 210 minutes after death. The brain presented frontal lobe predominant atrophy; brain and associated structures weight was 745 ^4 g and the interuncal distance was 2 ^3 cm. Following five days of fixation in four % paraformaldehyde and sample preparation, three ^m thick sections from medial frontal gyrus (MFG), superior temporal gyrus (STG), medial temporal gyrus (MTG), inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), hippocampus/collateral sulcus (HP-C), hippocampus/uncus (HP-Uncus), amygdala (Amy), insula (Ins), inferior parietal lobe (IPL), occipital lobe (OL), gyrus cinguli (GC), lentiform nucleus (LN), caudate nucleus (CN), thalamus/hypothalamus (T-H), cerebellum (CB), midbrain / pons (MP) and medulla oblongata (MO) were cut, deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) or processed for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for amyloid beta (A ^, 1:100; BAM-10, Mob410; DBS Emergo Europe, The Hague, The Netherlands), hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau, 1:100; AT8, MN1020, Thermo Fisher, Dreieich, DE), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1, 1:500; 019-19741; Wako, Neuss, Germany), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, 1:200; M0761, DAKO GmbH, Jena, DE), C-terminal Reelin (RELN-CT, 1:200; E-5, sc-25346, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Heidelberg, DE) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE, 1:100; Goat polyclonal, AB947, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, DE), and specific secondary antibodies anti-mouse and anti- rabbit (P0260 and P0447, respectively, DAKO GmbH, Jena, DE). neuronal nuclei (NeuN; 1:100; MAB377; Merck/Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), Visualization was achieved with 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Ventana, Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland) and the Ultraview Universal Detection Kit (Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland) according to manufacturer instructions. Automatic immunostaining was performed with a Ventana Benchmark XT system (Roche AG, Basel, Switzerland) according to manufacturer instructions. Selected brain areas were also stained with luxol fast blue (LFB) for myelin staining and Kluver-Barrera (KV) staining’s. Cresyl violet staining was used for neuronal perikarya. Neuropathological workup was performed diagnosis by experienced morphologists masked to the origin of the sample (M.G. and D.S-F.). Sections were scanned using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer automatic digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) and obtained images and regions of interest (cortex for cortical areas, whole stained sections for non-cortical areas) at a resolution of at least one pixel per ^m. Signal intensity, together with particles and total area was assessed, after performing color deconvolution and thresholding, in the brown (DAB) color channel by using ImageJ Software (version 1.52p, NIH, Bethesda, MA, USA,) (8). Neuronal counting was performed manually and normalized by area in selected regions of interest in the hippocampal and parahippocampal structures. Information on the statistical analysis is reported in the dedicated section. Additional Immunoprecipitation Details Mouse frontal cortex tissue was homogenized by two 15” pulses in ice cold M-PER protein extraction reagent (78503, Thermo Fisher) supplemented with phosphatases and proteases inhibitors using a homogenizer as described in the previous paragraph.100 µg of total proteins was pulled down using either anti- phosphotyrosine magnetic beads (clone 4G10, 16-282, Millipore), anti-total Dab1 agarose beads (clone G-5, sc-271136 AC, Santa Cruz) and anti-normal mouse IgG isotype control agarose beads (SC-2343, Santa Cruz). Prior immunoprecipitating the sample over night at four °C, ten % was removed and analyzed as input. Beads were washed in PBS upon collecting the unbound fraction and subsequently boiled in 4X reducing sample buffer for six minutes to allow the release of the immune precipitated proteins. Additional sequencing analysis via mass spectrometry Immunoprecipitated fractions obtained using the anti-Dab1 conjugated beads were electrophoretically separated on a ten % acrylamide precast gel (Biorad) and stained using blue Coomassie (Thermo Fisher). Excised gel bands were analyzed as a fee-for-service at the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Gel bands were subsequently dehydrated in acetonitrile followed to speed-vac. Rehydration of the bands were obtained in a solution of 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate supplemented with 12 ^5 ng/µL modified sequencing- grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at four ºC. Samples was washed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution. Upon overnight incubation a 37ºC, protein extraction was obtained by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution. Proteins were washed in a of 50% acetonitrile and one % formic acid (9). Reconstituted samples sequenced using nano-scale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column upon gradient elution using acetonitrile and formic acid via an electrospray ionization-LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro ion-trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Protein-specific fragment ions sequence was analyzed using the know peptide sequences using Sequest(10) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Additional Statistical Analysis Details All data presented is expressed as averaged values and error expressed either as standard error of the mean (s. e. m.) or standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla California USA, graphpad.com). P values less than 0 ^05 and a ^ of 0 ^05 were considered as statistically significant. We used Kruskal-Wallis (Dunn’s post-hoc analysis for multiple comparisons of four independent experiments to compare changes between primary cortical neurons treated with either MOCK, RELN WT or RELN H3448R and presented data as mean ± s. e. m. For the SPR data (FIG.2C & FIGs.7A-B), we verified the accuracy of the results via Chi square ( ^2) analysis and compared the sensorgrams (colored line) obtained experimentally with the sensorgrams generated mathematically by the BIAnalysis software (black line). Values ranging from one to two were interpreted as significant (accurate), and those below one as highly significant (highly accurate). Western blotting analyses presented in FIGs.2E-F were done using one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher’s LSD test for multiple comparisons by using GraphPad Prism 9. Neuropathological data (FIG.3) was analyzed, and graphs generated by using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; R-project.org.). Analyses included distribution analysis and correlation analysis were performed using Spearman’s Rho test. Brain color maps were created using the cerebroViz package for R. Statistical significance of all analyses was determined with * p≤0 ^05, **p≤0 ^01 and ***p≤0 ^001. Example 1.1 – Case report We identified a male carrier of the PSEN1 E280A mutation who remained cognitively intact until age 67. He completed five years of formal education in his home country (Colombia), and worked until he retired at age 64. He was married and had two children. First assessment at age 67 revealed limited verbal learning skills and language difficulties in the context of functional independence. The patient was diagnosed with MCI, characterized by short-term memory and verbal fluency declines at age 70. At age 72, his language had deteriorated further. He progressed to mild dementia at age 72 (Table 2). Cognitive decline was preceded by a urinary tract infection-related episode of septic shock. At age 73, he required assistance with basic and instrumental activities of daily living meeting criteria for moderate dementia. He died at the age of 74 years from aspiration pneumonia and his relatives agreed to a brain donation for neuropathology. The subject’s sister carried the PSEN1 E280A mutation, had severe dementia when she was first evaluated at age 64, and progressed to end-stage at age 72 (see pedigree in Fig.5A). According to family, she had depression, hypothyroidism, hypertension and cognitive decline at age 58 and developed dementia at age 61. Dementia was preceded by ocular trauma and tibia fracture after a fall, which required surgery under general anesthesia. She died at age 73 of sepsis of pulmonary origin. Table 2. Test Scores and Percentiles for Age & Education. The subject’s age and education-adjusted neuropsychological test scores reveal a pattern of significant global and progressive cognitive decline during a 5-year assessment period. Note. MMSE, Mini Mental Status Examination; CERAD, Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease Test Battery; GDS, Geriatric Depression Scale; EDG, Global Deterioration Scale. Percentiles were calculated using age and education-based norms from a Colombian population at age 65 and above and expressed with mean and standard deviation (SD); see Torres, Vila-Castelar et al. 2019 (11) for full description of the neuropsychological measures and normative data. The following guidelines can be used for a qualitative interpretation of his performance: 90-75 percentiles=above average; 74-25 percentiles=average; 24-9 percentiles=below average; 8-2 percentiles=borderline; 1=extremely low.*** Example 1.2 – Identification of RELN-COLBOS mutation The patient was enrolled in the Colombia-Boston biomarker research study (COLBOS) and underwent neuroimaging examinations at MGH when he was 73 years old. Amyloid PET, measured by cortical-to-cerebellar Pittsburgh compound B (PiB), revealed that the subject’s levels of cortical Aβ plaque burden were higher (distribution volume ratio, DVR=1 ^77) compared to that of younger MCI carriers from this kindred with a typical age of onset (DVRs 1 ^49–1 ^60, Fig.1). Tau tangle burden in the inferior temporal lobe, measured by flortaucipir (FTP), was similar to that seen in younger PSEN1 E280A MCI carriers with typical age of onset (1 ^78 SUVR). However, he had relatively limited tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex (EC=1 ^34 SUVR, Fig.1A, C) and in other neocortical regions, such as the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus (PCC=1 ^51; Precuneus=1 ^49 SUVR, Fig. 1A), which usually show greater levels of tau pathology in PSEN1 E280A carriers who develop MCI and dementia at typical age (3) (Fig.1). Sparing of the entorhinal cortex from tau pathology is a salient feature in the RELN-COLBOS case that could be critical for the protection phenotype. Measurements of metabolic rate for glucose in the precuneus-to-whole brain region using fluorodeoxyglucose PET showed relatively preserved metabolism (Fig.1). He had brain atrophy, measured by MRI-based hippocampal-to-whole brain volume similar to typical MCI carriers. These imaging findings suggest that in this patient as well as in the APOE3 Christchurch homozygote case,(2) protection against ADAD dementia may be mediated through a mechanism limiting regional tau pathology even in the face of high amyloid burden and substantial tau pathology in brain regions other than the medial temporal lobe (Fig.1). Our genetic analyses confirmed that the subject was a heterozygote carrier of the PSEN1 E280A mutation (confirmed by single cell RNA sequencing), ruled out the presence of the Christchurch mutation (subject was APOE3/APOE3, and had normal blood lipid profile), and identified a heterozygous variant in RELN (H3447R, Fig. 5B), which we named “RELN-COLBOS”, as the most promising missense variant potentially contributing to the phenotype in the protected subject. The RELN- COLBOS variant was only found in the subject and his sister (also APOE3/APOE3), who also had late onset of cognitive decline. In brief, we focused on the RELN- COLBOS variant because it ranked in the top three candidate genes in the Genomizer priority score analysis and because RELN is functionally closely related to APOE, the gene mutated in the other case with extreme protection against ADAD (2). Example 1.3 – Molecular analysis of RELN-COLBOS variant RELN binding triggers clustering and activation of VLDLr and APOER2, leading to a signaling cascade regulating disabled 1 (Dab1) activity, thus resulting in diminished tau phosphorylation.(4-7) RELN-COLBOS was about twice as effective at triggering Dab1 phosphorylation compared to wild type (WT) RELN (Fig.2A, p=0 ^0246) and reduced tau phosphorylation at position 396, an early marker of tauopathy (8-10), in primary culture mouse cortical neurons (FIGs.6A-B). RELN COLBOS did not directly impact binding of RELN to VLDLr or APOER2 in cell-free binding assays. The C-terminal region of RELN (CTR-RELN), where the H3447R variant is located, modulates signaling indirectly via interactions with a previously unidentified co-receptor on cell membranes.(11) CTR-RELN has many basic amino acids that are extremely well conserved across species (11), which we hypothesized could mediate interactions with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Interactions with GAGs are a rate- limiting step in the interaction of ApoE with some receptors (12) whereas GAGs’ role in RELN activity has not been fully resolved (11, 13). We used affinity chromatography to examine heparin (a type of GAG) binding of recombinant CTR RELN peptides. CTR RELN WT and CTR RELN H3447R bound to heparin. CTR RELN H3447R required higher NaCl salt concentrations to be released from the heparin column suggesting increased binding affinity (Fig.2B). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measures of kinetic constants showed that the affinity of CTR RELN H3447R is about twice that observed in the WT (Fig.2C). Substitution of histidine at position 3447 with aspartic acid, a highly acidic amino acid (H3447D), reduced heparin interactions whereas substitution for lysine (H3447K), a basic amino acid, had minimal effects, further supporting a critical role for position 3447 in GAG binding. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measures of kinetic constants showed that the affinity of CTR RELN H3447R is about twice that observed in the WT: H3447R>WT>H3447K>>>H3447D (Fig.2C, & Fig.7A, B). RELN H3447D could not be produced in sufficient quantities for signaling analysis. This limitation is consistent with previous reports of specific mutations of the C- terminus that limit secretion of RELN (52). We used ELISA to evaluate direct binding of recombinant RELN H3448R to canonical RELN receptors VLDLr and APOER2 (53) to further examine the molecular mechanism leading to the observed gain-of-function. We used experimental conditions with RELN H3448R, RELN WT, or with an equimolar mixture of WT and variant proteins because RELN oligomerization is a critical property modulating binding to receptors (53). In all conditions, full-length RELN H3448R and RELN WT did not differ in their ability to bind to VLDLr or APOER2. We further determined that the C-terminal region of RELN (CTR-RELN) WT or CTR-RELN H3447R recombinant peptides were unable to bind directly to VLDLr or APOER2. This finding confirms previous reports demonstrating that the fifth and sixth reelin repeats of RELN (R5-6) are necessary to mediate binding to the receptors (53). We concluded that the gain-of-function of the RELN H3447R variant was not likely explained by direct changes in binding affinity for VLDLr or APOER2 receptors. Example 1.4 – Disease-modifying effects of RELN-COLBOS mutation We generated a knock-in mouse model carrying the equivalent of the RELN- COLBOS variant (H3448R or mRELN-H3448R (11)) to further support the genetic imputation of causality, a common practice to study rare variants. This mouse model is viable, fertile, and lacks overt structural and phenotypic brain abnormalities of RELN loss-of-function variants (e.g. cortex lamination defects, abnormal neuronal migration, and cerebellar hypotrophy) (14, 15). Analyses of cerebellum from mice with the mRELN-COLBOS confirmed the observation of a gain-of-function for RELN- H3448R as determined by enhanced phosphorylation of Dab1 in males (FIG.2D, F, p=0 ^0284) and revealed a propensity for the formation of higher molecular protein oligomers for RELN-COLBOS, a feature that may be critical for enhanced activity (16). The cerebellum is a target of RELN phenotypes in mice and humans (14, 15). Morphological analysis revealed a mild, yet statistically significant increase in the number of cerebellar neurons in mice with the RELN-COLBOS variant. This supports the hypothesis of a gain-of-function mechanism, although the neuronal density phenotype was not observed in other brain regions. This mouse model allowed us to examine sexually dimorphic effects of the RELN-COLBOS variant, a feature that has been described for conditions linked to genetic variations in RELN including schizophrenia, bipolar disease, autism, and Alzheimer’s disease (17-22). Increased Dab1 phosphorylation and enhanced oligomerization of RELN were observed only in male mice (FIG.2D). This finding was consistent with our observation of optimal association of RELN-COLBOS with protection against ADAD in a male vs. a female case. Homozygosity was required to detect changes in Dab1 activity and in GSK3 ^ activity (another downstream target of RELN signaling) associated with the RELN-COLBOS variant. Altogether, these data indicate that RELN H3447R is a gain-of-function (hypermorph) variant. To attempt to correlate the phenotypes of RELN-COLBOS in mice and human, we employed a crossbreeding strategy using our knock-in mouse model and a tauopathy mouse model, specifically the STOCK Tg(Prnp- MAPT*P301L)JNPL3Hlmc mouse from Dr. Hutton's lab, distributed by Taconic. This mouse model expresses a mutation in the tau gene, leading to accumulation of tau tangles and neuronal loss in specific brain regions, commonly used to study tauopathies23. The decision to use this mouse model was based on the known effects of RELN signaling on tau phosphorylation24, as well as our clinical observations of a relative reduction of tauopathy in certain brain regions from post-mortem human brain samples of the protected case. Our study found that male P301L mice expressing the RELN-COLBOS allele had a substantial reduction of human tau phosphorylation (ptau205) in the hippocampus (Fig.2J-K) and medulla oblongata as compared to controls (Fig.2J). We also observed that the abnormal limb clasping response, which is a common consequence of tauopathy in mice, was significantly rescued in RELN- COLBOS mice with the tau transgene (Fig.2L-M). Although additional studies of this model are necessary, our findings strongly support our hypothesis of RELN-COLBOS is a gain-of-function mutation and it is likely genetically implicated in the resilience to tauopathy. This analysis also shows direct evidence of a rescue in a mouse model with a MAPT mutation linked to frontotemporal dementia. Postmortem examination of the case indicated neuropathological evidence of severe AD (classified as CERAD C, Braak VI stage and Thal phase 5) with extensive amyloid and tau pathology (Fig.3A). Recently, we reported the neuropathological profile of the PSEN1 E280A carrier homozygous for the APOE Christchurch mutation. This case showed a unique pathological phenotype among PSEN1 E280A cases with remarkably low ptau pathology in most brain regions except in the visual primary cortex (23). In contrast, side-by-side comparisons showed that the RELN- COLBOS case had more ptau pathology relative to the APOEch case except in specific regions. Both cases showed extensive A ^ pathology in all evaluated areas, albeit with some individual differences. We focused our analysis on hippocampus and associated cortices because these structures are known to be affected early in AD (24). Neurons within layer II of the entorhinal cortex and entorhinal cortex neurons in general are particularly vulnerable to aging and AD (25). We measured neuronal density in hippocampal and parahippocampal areas of the RELN-COLBOS case, the AD resistant APOEch case, typical PSEN1 E280A cases and typical sporadic AD cases (FIG.3B). We found that lower AD pathology was associated with high neuronal density in entorhinal cortex of the RELN-COLBOS case compared to the APOEch case or the FAD and sporadic AD controls (FIG.3C). This association was not apparent in other subregions such as CA1 (FIG.3C; S17 & S18). RELN-COLBOS and APOEch cases showed distinctively lower intraneuronal ApoE signal compared with FAD and sporadic AD controls (FIG. 3D) whereas RELN-COLBOS showed higher Reelin intracellular signal in the white matter (FIG.3D). Neuropathological findings are consistent with our in vivo neuroimaging observations and confirm a potential role for the integrity of the entorhinal cortex as a target of RELN-mediated mechanisms critical for the resilience to ADAD. Example 2. In silico modeling of Reelin In order to understand the potential importance of the Reelin CTR, computational analysis was used to show that the RELN CTR, including basic AA likely to form a charge-based binding site, was highly conserved across mammalian species. We also show that the Reelin CTR is likely to be intrinsically disordered. Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within proteins lack defined tertiary structure and may be important to several biological functions, including protein interaction. Additionally, IDRs may play a role in interactions within plaque deposits in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases including AD. Previous work has shown that the Reelin CTR is highly conserved across vertebrate species (11). This work also showed that Reelin was not required for secretion but may play a role in downstream signaling. Methods A phylogenetic tree was created using BEAST, which uses Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to create the tree based on the Reelin CTR sequences. PONDR ® was used to assess intrinsically disordered regions of RELN. Specifically, VL-XT (Variously Long disordered regions and X-ray characterized Terminal disordered regions) is a combination of three feedforward neural networks. The individual neural networks were trained on long regions of disorder (greater than 39 AAs), n-terminal disorder, and c-terminal disorder. Results The Reelin CTR is highly conserved The Reelin CTR is also highly conserved across mammalian species (FIG.8). It is therefore hypothesized that the C-terminal region of Reelin is important for Reelin binding to HSPG and regulation of subsequent downstream pathways. Among species that were available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, there is a high level of conservation at position 3447 across most mammalian species except for in horses (Equus caballus, Equus asinus, Equus przewalskii). The Reelin CTR contains a GAG-binding motif Initial structural data suggests that there may be two binding sites at the c- terminal region (FIG.9). The key AA positions that interact with GAGs can be predicted based on the orientation of arginines in the known heparin-binding motif ((B)Bxx(x/B)BxxB(B)), where B represents positively charged AAs and (x) represents non-consensus AAs (29). Basic AA interactions with acidic GAGs are largely driven by electrostatic forces (30). Therefore, it is hypothesized that these basic amino acids may be especially important for GAG interaction, and the c- terminal region may contain a binding site that interacts with GAGs. H3447 is oriented in the same direction as other basic amino acids Bioinformatic analyses showed that the RELN CTR is highly conserved across mammalian species, including the H3447R position (purple) found to be mutated in the AD resilient case. Many of the conserved amino acids are highly basic residues suggesting the possibility of binding to GAGs. The basic AAs shown in magenta, including position 3447, are oriented on the same side which may indicate a primary role in interactions with heparin. Here, the orientation of basic amino acids may contribute to creating a binding site. Conclusion The Reelin CTR is highly conserved across a wide variety of species. The basic AAs that are hypothesized to contribute to GAG interaction have >90% conservation. The only species with a different AA in position 3447 are in the horse family (Q3447), which notably is uncharged and should not make a significant difference compared to weakly basic histidine. Furthermore, these basic AAs, including position H3447R, are oriented on the same side of the alpha-helix, which has previously been shown to be an important aspect of GAG interaction. Example 3: Kinetics of Reelin-heparin interactions In order to further understand the kinetics of RELN CTR – Heparin interaction, Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) adds additional support to the proposed neuroprotective mechanism of the H3447R variant. The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) shows that H3447R has ~2x the binding affinity of H3447. Furthermore, bio-layer interferometry was used to further corroborate these results. Methods Surface plasmon resonance Surface plasmon resonance assay (SPR) was used for performing binding kinetics using a Biacore 3000 Instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25 ^C following previously published protocols 3424 fee-for-service by Precision Antibody (Maryland, USA). Heparin was covalently linked to streptavidin coated chip at 13 response units (RU) concentration and unoccupied sites were blocked with biocytin. Antigen was flowed over the chip using a range of single analyte concentrations prepared in DPBS buffer and using a flow rate of 30 μL/min. Binding of antigen to the ligand was monitored in real time to obtain on (ka) and off (kd) rates. The equilibrium constant (KD) was calculated from the observed ka and kd. Accuracy of the SPR analysis was determined via Chi square (2) analysis as described in the statistical analysis section. Bio-layer Interferometry (BLI) We used Fc-fusion Reelin CTR peptides since peptides alone would be smaller than the limit of detection in this experimental design. To assess heparin - Fc- Reelin interaction, the octet system (bio-layer interferometry) was used to assess heparin-protein kinetics.50µg/mL biotinylated heparin was immobilized on the biosensor tip surface for 300sec on preconditioned biosensors. This was followed by quenching with biocytin at 50µg/ml, baseline buffer diluent for 120 sec, 200nM of analyte (Fc-fusion proteins) for 120 sec, and disassociation in assay buffer for 120 sec. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) was additionally used to assess NRP1-protein kinetics at 300C and 1000rpm agitation.1mg/mL NRP1 (R&D 3870-N1-025) was biotinylated at a 1:2 molar ratio, desalted, and immobilized on the SA biosensor tip (Pall ForteBio) surface. This was followed by 1) 180 seconds baseline buffer diluent, 2) loading of the ligand (NRP1), 3) 180 seconds baseline buffer diluent, 4) 240 seconds association (analyte), and 5) 300 seconds disassociation in assay buffer. Assay buffer: SD Buffer (pH7.4 PBS, 0.05% tween20, 0.01% BSA). The experimental data were fit with the 1:1 binding model and analyzed with global fitting using Octet Data Analysis software to calculate KD. Results We recently showed that the RELN CTR H3447R peptide had 2-fold higher interaction with heparin relative to RELN WT with surface plasmon resonance (SPR; submitted to NEJM). These kinetics were assessed with a synthetic peptide (AA3431 to AA3460). We designed Fc-fused RELN CTR proteins to confirm this finding in a protein produced in mammalian cells. The Fc-fusion RELN WT and H3447R interactions with heparin were assessed using bio-layer interferometry (BLI; FIG. 1C). These proteins are cleaved by furin during production in mammalian cells, resulting in short RELN CTR variants lacking the last six amino acids. In this configuration, RELN H3447R also has about 2-fold higher affinity to heparin compared to WT. We found that that the Ka is the main contributor to the difference in KD values, which indicates that either the variant needs less energy to interact with heparin or that this variant saturates the heparin substrate twice as fast in comparison to WT. Therefore, the CTR sequence upstream of Furin cleavage may contribute to CTR–heparin affinity in the presence of the H3447R mutation. Conclusion Kinetic data shows that RELN H3447R has ~2-fold increased interaction with heparin compared to RELN WT. Because the difference is relatively small, it is relevant that this difference was seen across two different experimental systems with both long and short RELN variants. These data indicate that RELN H3447R may increase association of RELN and GAGs and may therefore have a competitive advantage compared to other molecular or protein interactions with GAGs in vivo. Example 4: Affinity data of Reelin-heparin interactions High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to assess the interaction between HSPGs and the reelin CTR. Delayed peak interactions in isotonic PBS supplemented with 1M KCl indicate increased peptide-heparin interaction. Our data indicated delayed peak retention time between 0 – 2 arginines; this difference in peak retention time was observed in both long and short peptides. Therefore, the basic amino acids in the 3446-3447 positions are important to heparin interaction. Since all short peptides have earlier peak retention times, there may be a second binding site in the last 6 AAs of the long peptide sequence. We also show a basic mutation at the 3447 position has a later peak retention time in comparison to neutral (H) or acidic (D) AAs. Methods Heparin Column Chromatography To assess Reelin-heparin binding affinity, Reelin variants were run on a heparin column with steps of 0.05M in a range of 0.05-1M NaCl over 201 mL column volumes in 20 mM Tris HCl, as described in Arboleda et. al 2019 (2). Sample fractions were eluted at an increasing NaCl step size to determine the ionic strength needed to disrupt the binding between Reelin and heparin. Therefore, the stronger the interaction, the higher concentration of salt would be needed to disrupt the bond. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) HPLC gives a more accurate 50 µl of 0.3µg/µL uncleaved or cleaved WT Reelin peptide was used at 0.3ml/min in 0.15MKCl, 10mM PBS.0-13.5min: 0.15M KCl to load sample, 13.5-14.5min: ramp to 0.5M KCl, 14.5-24.5min: 0.5-1M KCl gradient (ramp), 24.5-45min: 1M KCl (isocratic elution), 45-55min: 1M KCl at 0.6ml/min (wash), 55.0-56.0min: ramp to 0.15M KCl at 0.3 ml/min, 56.0-59.0min: 0.15M KCl (reset column). Fluorescence Intensities were measured at an excitation wavelength of 260 nm and emission wavelength of 290 nm, based on fluorescence properties of aromatic amino acids. To assess fluorescence properties of peptides, 15ul of ~0.6ug/mL of peptide was diluted in 500uL of 0.15MKCl, 10mM PBS, and peak excitation and emission of peptides was calculated from the 2D graphical data. Method development for HPLC The column chromatography method was adapted from previous research from the laboratory (2). Based on the column chromatography data, the initial protocol used a NaCl gradien from 0 – 1 M and a 5M salt wash to reset the HPLC column. However, the high salt gradient was corrosive to the HPLC machine parts. Therefore, KCl was considered because the salt has a higher ionic strength compared to NaCl. A lower molar concentration of a buffer with KCl could be used to disrupt heparin – Reelin CTR interactions compared to NaCl to help keep the HPLC pumps free of residual salts and potential corrosion. Since a lower concentration of salt was used, the amount of time needed at an isotonic hold of 1M KCl was extended until the peptide signal could not be detected before the column was equilibrated for the next sample. Results Heparin column chromatography shows RELN H3447R enables increased interaction with heparin Eluted peptides from heparin column chromatography were quantified at each 0.05 M NaCl step were assessed with both nanodrop and ELISA. Overall, nanodrop measurements had sharper, more defined peaks compared to ELISA perhaps because ELISA is dependent on antibody affinity to the RELN CTR while nanodrop measurements directly quantify the amount of peptide. The peak elution step is determined as the maximum ratio to input per sample. For all RELN variants long (uncleaved) peptides had later peak retention times compared to short peptides, suggesting that the last 6 AAs may include a heparin binding site. Furthermore, basic AAs in position 3447 (R, K) have a peak elution at a higher salt concentration compared to WT or H3447D. The charge of AAs at position 3447 may therefore be an important factor in RELN CTR - GAG interaction. While heparin column chromatography was able to quantify RELN CTR – heparin interaction to an extent, HPLC can give more accurate quantification of this interaction using a gradient. Representative normalized peaks show that RELN H3447R has delayed peak times compared to RELN WT for both long and short peptides. Significant differences are characterized as average peaks with greater than 30 seconds between retention times. Conclusion Chromatography data showed that the RELN H3447R mutation increased heparin interaction as a model for overall GAG interaction. The difference in retention time of RELN peptide variants is due to the AA mutation rather than a change in fluorescence properties or a change in detectability of the peptide since the peak excitation and emission spectra remain similar across peptide variants. Additional mutations can include substitutions in other key arginine residues (R3451, R3454, and R3458) that are oriented with H3447R to contribute to RELN CTR – GAG interaction. Example 5: Other potential Reelin CTR interactions Recent work shows that the reelin CTR also interacts with neuropilin (NRP1) (46). This study found that the last 6 AAs after the furin cleavage site were critical for NRP1 interaction. The uncleaved “long” CTR-RELN interacts with NRP1 and the cleaved “short” CTR-RELN does not (46). BLI was therefore used to further assess whether the H3447R mutation affects NRP1-RELN CTR interactions. All known NRP1 binding domains have been shown to have a C-terminal arginine with a motif called CendR (R/KXXR/K) (47). Specifically, the C-terminal arginine is relevant to binding to the NRP1 b1-b2 domain (48). Therefore, by sequence alone, the RELN CTR may have additional interactions beyond GAGs. In particular, RELN H3447R may contribute to optimizing the NRP1 binding motif especially after furin cleavage. Methods Docking NRP1 and RELN CTR structures were uploaded to ClusPro 2.0 (cluspro.org/), to model these protein interactions. In brief, the top 1000 rotatamers with the lowest scores out of 70,000 rotations are chosen. The algorithm clusters these 1000 rotations, which entails ranking positions with the most neighbors within a 9 Å RMSD radius. The top position then becomes the center of the first cluster, and this process is repeated to rank up to 30 clusters based on size (i.e. number of neighbors). Next, energy minimization removes steric overlaps. Therefore, ClusPro considers the lowest energy structures of the largest clusters rather than just energy minimization alone (49, 50). The output of the ClusPro algorithm is a list of most probable conformations. One model for each ApoE peptide was taken as preliminary data for further analysis with PyMol Version 2.3.3 (pymol.org/). In the future, the top three lowest-energy models ranked by ClusPro will be assessed. Polar contacts between peptides were defined by the PyMol software as contacts within 3 Å through the 'Measurement Mode' function. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) was used to assess NRP1-protein kinetics at 30 0C and 1000rpm agitation using previously published methods.1mg/mL NRP1 (R&D 3870-N1-025) was biotinylated at a 1:2 molar ratio, desalted, and immobilized on the SA biosensor tip (Pall ForteBio) surface. This was followed by 1) 180 seconds baseline buffer diluent, 2) loading of the ligand (NRP1), 3) 180 seconds baseline buffer diluent, 4) 240 seconds association (analyte), and 5) 300 seconds disassociation in assay buffer. Assay buffer: SD Buffer (pH7.4 PBS, 0.05% tween20, 0.01% BSA). The experimental data were fit with the 1:1 binding model and analyzed with global fitting using Octet Data Analysis software to calculate KD. Results Molecular docking suggests that the alpha- and beta- GAG binding sites overlap with the NRP1 binding site. However, n-terminal AAs of the RELN CTR may also contribute to NRP1 interactions. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to interact with NRP1 and was therefore used as a positive control (31). As previously mentioned, our Fc- fusion proteins were made in mammalian cells thus were expected to be cleaved by Furin. Previously published data concluded that WT CTR did not bind NRP1 after removal of the last six amino acids by Furin. We confirmed enhanced interactions of CTR-RELN H3447R with heparin through the use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC, Fig.2G) and biolayer interferometry (BLI, Fig.2H). The Ka was found to be the main contributor to the difference in Kd values, and the mutant CTR-RELN was found to have a more negative Gibbs free energy in comparison to WT, suggesting that the COLBOS mutation enables spontaneous CTR-RELN reactions with heparin. Our nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Fig.2I, Fig.9) study revealed that the CTR-RELN may have an alpha-helix structure including a flexible region with a domain we named 'Flexibility Vertex' in the presence of trifluoroethanol, though it may be unstructured under native conditions as revealed by circular dicroism (Table 3). Table 3. Secondary structure analysis of circular dichroism spectroscopy data of CTR-RELN WT alone or with 50% TFE Heparin binding analyses of a library of mutant CTR-RELN peptides uncovered two binding sites for GAGs which we named as 'alpha-GAG binding site' and 'beta-GAG binding site' (Fig.9). The alpha-GAG binding site is located in the last six amino acids and overlaps with a previously identified binding site for Neurophilin 1 (NRP1), which is released by Furin. The beta-GAG binding site is located upstream of the Furin cleavage site and spans amino acids 3446 through 3451. Our research also found that CTR-RELN COLBOS has a 10-fold higher affinity for NRP-1 compared to the wild-type version of CTR-RELN (Table 4), due to the optimization of the beta-GAG binding site. We conducted extensive studies of mutant CTR-RELN interactions with heparin by HPLC (Figs.11-D), BLI (Fig.2H), and NMR structure (Fig.2I, 9) to support these assertions. Table 4. Analysis of binding parameter of CTR-RELN-NRP-1 interactions Our data showed the RELN CTR peptide without the alpha-GAG binding site located in the last six amino acids of RELN CTR had 100-fold less affinity for NRP1 than that of VEGF, consistent with the previously published data. However, with the H3447R mutation, the affinity was 10-fold higher in comparison to WT, suggesting that H3447R forms a new binding site or significantly increase affinity for NRP1 via the beta-GAG site. In sum, RELN H3447R peptide has ~10-fold increased affinity to NRP1 in comparison to WT RELN peptide, much closer to the affinity range of VEGF, thus it is gain-of-function. Conclusion Previously published data showed that NRP1 interaction was lost in WT short RELN peptides. Data here adds more to the story, where WT short has significantly less interaction with NRP1, especially compared to VEGF. However, these data support the hypothesis that RELN H3447R adds a new beta-GAG binding site or substantially optimizes it, considering the mutation rescues RELN CTR – NRP1 interaction by ~10-fold. Accordingly, RELN gain-of-function may be achieved by introducing the H3447R variant and/or reducing furin cleavage of the RELN-CTR by introducing the R3454A. Example 6. Structural Analysis of Reelin Circular dichroism (CD) was used to further understand the unstructured nature of the Reelin CTR. The modelling results showed that the Reelin CTR may have higher fluctuations in the most disordered area of the Reelin protein. Furthermore, recently published data showed a high resolution structure of the CR8 within the C-terminus of Reelin, but were unable to characterize the Reelin CTR, potentially due to the flexibility of the domain (32). NMR helped get a high resolution structure conditions by using circular dichroism (CD) and found that 50% TFE (2, 2, 2-Trifluoroethanol) was needed to stabilize the WT Reelin peptide structure. Both approaches give insight into the unstructured region of the RELN CTR. In silico approaches add additional support, showing that the flexible region can be predicted through a combination of the RELN CTR sequence as well as known disordered regions of other proteins. Methods Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) NMA is a principle component analysis (PCA) based method that considers the harmonic potential of the peptide, where the force field is simplified to a ball-and spring elastic network model. The model considers the harmonic potential of the Ca atom of each AA as a node connected by springs. Here, the energy function is minimized by diagonalizing the Hessian matrix consisting of the second derivative of potential energies (33). Predictor of Natural Disordered Regions (PONDR) VL-XT disorder analysis This algorithm uses feed-forward neural networks to predict regions of disorder based on the AA sequence. VL-XT combines three feedforward neural networks trained on: 1) variously long regions (VL), 2) X-Ray characterized N- terminus, and 3) X-ray characterized C-terminus (XT). Compared to NMA, VL-XT is able to use known disordered regions of other proteins to predict regions of disorder. Circular Dichroism The CD signal was recorded at the wavelengths ranging from 190 to 260 nm at 0.1 nm intervals using a 1 mm pathlength quartz cuvette. The samples were scanned at 50 nm/min with a 1 nm bandwidth and a 2 second integration time. Data was plotted as the average of four spectra. Data was deconvoluted using the online deconvolution software BeStSel (bestsel.elte.hu/). 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structures The NMR structure was completed as a fee-for service. The final NMR sample consisted of 50% (V/V) H2O, 50% (V/V) of 98% pure 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol- d2 (CF3CD2OH), 0.25 mM DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid, dissolved in H2O) as the internal standard, and ~3.3 mM reelin peptide.1H TOCSY (80ms spin lock time), NOESY (200 ms mixing time), 1H-15N HSQC, 1H-13C HSQC experiments were performed at 25°C on an Agilent 600 MHz NMR Spectrometer (DD2). Data was analyzed with NMRPipe and CCPNmr 2.4.2; structures were calculated with Cns 1.2.1 and aria 2.3.2. In total 200 structures were calculated, and the 20 lowest energy structures were selected. Results Structural characterization of the RELN CTR reveals an alpha helix with a flexible arm We determined RELN CTR was highly unstructured under native conditions using circular dichroism (CD). Addition of 50% TFE (2, 2, 2-Trifluoroethanol) stabilized the unstructured CTR and enabled characterization of the domain. With 50% TFE, the peptide secondary structure is more closely an alpha-helix, with characteristic negative minima at 208 nm and 222 nm. We cannot exclude the presence of unstructured regions within the RELN CTR even in the presence of TFE. The structure of disordered peptides may account for the “antiparallel β-sheet” or “other categories” found as a larger percentage structure in the peptide alone compared to the peptide with 50% TFE (34,35). The CD results informed experimental conditions for NMR to resolve the Reelin CTR at atomic resolution. NMR is advantageous for smaller proteins, since it can capture dynamics and forgoes the need for crystallization (51). The 20 lowest energy structures were used to create the final NMR structure of WT RELN CTR with an approximate resolution of 2.8 Å. With this technique, we confirmed that the C- terminal domain of RELN in the presence of TFE forms an alpha helix with a highly flexible arm towards the C-terminal region. The vertex of the flexible region spans from the glycine residue at position 3444 to the histidine 3447 mutated in the protected case. We have named this region the flexibility vertex domain (FVD). Consensus motifs for GAG binding include basic amino acids on the same side of the alpha helix and on contiguous turns separated by ~3.5 amino acids to allow for strong bonds (36). Additionally, the 20 lowest energy structures show that the helix containing position 3447 is unwinded, potentially exposing H3447R for GAG interactions. Reelin CTR – GAG interactions depend on basic AAs near H3447R Our structural data in conjunction with our functional analysis indicate that the alpha-GAG binding site is likely to depend upon R3454, R3457, and R3458. As we concluded earlier from our functional studies, R3446 also mediates GAG interactions probably in conjunction with R3451 comprising the beta-GAG binding side. It is clear from the structure that the arginine introduced by the mutation at position 3447 found in the protected case is properly orientated for GAG interactions. Importantly, the new beta-GAG binding site is not cleaved by Furin, becoming a constitutively active site for RELN interaction with GAGs, NRP1 and potentially other receptors. Polar contacts between the WT RELN CTR and heparin suggest that this interaction is likely due to basic amino acids in the alpha- and beta- GAG binding sites (FIG.9). Reelin C-terminal peptides have more atomic fluctuation in the alpha- and beta- GAG binding sites The glycine residue is marked to show the structured region found in NMR spectra towards n-terminus region of the peptide. Data suggests the last 6 AAs of H3447R long have more fluctuation in comparison to WT Reelin long. WT and H3447R Reelin short peptides were comparable; overall, the short peptides had decreased fluctuation in comparison to long peptides. Atomic fluctuation was measured as the root mean square deviation across all normal modes. Modelling shows that the Reelin CTR has increased disorder To assess the flexibility of the region, the harmonic potential of each amino acid was first assessed using Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) (37). NMA shows that long peptides have increased flexibility, with RELN H3447R long having increased flexibility in comparison to WT long. Reelin short peptides show similar flexibility. NMA overall shows that long peptides have increased flexibility compared to short peptides; however, since all other peptides besides WT long were modelled peptides, these results may not be fully accurate. In contrast, Predictor of Natural Disordered Region (PONDR) analysis uses only the AA sequence to score the relative disorder of RELN variants. WT Long has a score of 0.9032 in AAs 3444-3460 compared to H3447R long which has a score of 0.9225 in AAs 3440-3460. Therefore, the H3447R mutation increases disorder in the RELN CTR and may contribute to increased ability to bind GAGs or inhibit AB plaque formation. In contrast, R3446H decreases the disordered region to 3447-3460 with an average score of 0.8583. Arginines in the beta-GAG binding site may therefore contribute to increased disorder in the Reelin CTR. VL-XT, a neural network-based approach, more closely predicted the disordered region of the RELN CTR found in experimental data. Here, the predicted disordered region at the RELN C-terminus started at G3444, which was also shown in the 20 lowest energy NMR structures. Because RELN CTR is extremely well conserved across species and because it is also highly disordered it stands to reason that its function require a highly disordered nature. Conclusion The RELN CTR has an unstructured region beginning with the FVD that also contains the alpha- and beta- GAG binding site. The RELN H3447R mutation creates a new beta-GAG binding site at a position with an orientation that aligns with the other basic amino acids within the GAG binding motif to contribute to GAG interaction. Furthermore, computational analysis confirms that the region from G3444 – P3460 is highly disordered. Disordered regions may contribute to increased cellular interactions with GAGs or other proteins. NMA and VL-XT, a machine learning based approach using known disordered regions, were used to estimate potential flexibility within the RELN CTR. Example 7. The Reelin CTR modulates Aβ aggregation While the previous experiments suggest a mechanism of protection based on RELN – GAG interaction, it is important to assess if RELN H3447R directly modulates known hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. Previous studies suggest that disordered molecular regions may modulate Aβ aggregation (38); it has also been reported that purified RELN reduces amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation in vitro (39). Therefore, we examined whether this effect was attributed to the CTR-RELN. Methods Thioflavin T (ThT) binds to amyloids and has also been shown to linearly correlate to amyloid concentration. Therefore, the ThT assay can be used to quantify AB aggregation using previously developed methods (40). We incubated CTR-RELN with Aβ and monitored aggregation using a ThioflavinT fluorescence assay normalized to the maximum ThT emission of Aβ only. We also assayed Aβ in the presence of morin, a known inhibitor (41), as a negative control. Long and short WT and H3447R RELN CTR peptides were included to better understand the potential role of the H3447R mutation in amyloid pathology (FIG.14 and 15. Negative controls included long and short RELN CTR peptides with neutrally charged AAs (histidines) in place of basic AAs in the alpha- and beta-GAG binding sites. Results The RELN peptide alone does not trigger ThT fluorescence (FIG.15). We found that RELN CTR significantly reduced amyloid aggregation and that the long peptides were as effective as the short peptides (FIGs.14A-B, 15). RELN H3447R variant peptides were similarly effective at inhibiting ThT aggregation as WT for both long and short variants (FIG.14A-B). Interestingly, the antiaggregating effect of CTR-RELN was significantly reduced when R3431, K3432, and R3446 were replaced with histidines in the short peptide variant, thus suggesting that N-terminal amino acids may play a primary role in interacting with the amyloid seed (FIG.14B). H3447D long and H3447K long similarly decrease aggregation, but H3447D short had ~3-fold higher aggregation compared to H3447K short. Therefore, the charge of the beta-GAG binding site may not be the only contributing factor affecting interaction with Aβ plaques. This hypothesis is further supported by controls (FIG. 14B) where several arginines in the RELN CTR were substituted with histidines, including in the alpha-GAG binding site. In this case, there was significantly higher Aβ aggregation in the sample with short peptides compared to long peptides. Negative controls show minimal ThT flourescence with the peptide alone without Aβ. Conclusion The RELN CTR may play a role in AB aggregation, but the mechanism may rely on the overall flexibility of the peptide rather than the charge of the interaction, considering amyloidogenicity of AB is enhanced by sequence enrichment of hydrophobic AA residues (42). It has previously been shown that intrinsically disordered protein (IDPs), such as certain cleaved APP variants, can form seeds for amyloid aggregation. Proteins that have IDPs can potentially interact with amyloid aggregates in a sequence independent manner (Ikeda et al., Sci Rep.2020 Jul 23;10(1):12334). However, in general, net charge and hydrophobicity may increase the likelihood of disordered regions. Therefore, substituting arginines for histidines may have some contribution towards increased aggregation. RELN peptides with more flexible AAs (H) in key positions at the N- terminus, alpha-, and beta- GAG sites decreased ThT fluorescence to a similar level as WT Long. However, AB aggregation increased ~4.5-fold with a similar short peptide with the beta – GAG site removed. Additional peptides can include substituting the most flexible AA in the RELN CTR (G3444) to a less flexible AA such as histidine with intermediate flexibility or proline which would significantly decrease flexibility. Example 8. The Reelin CTR enhances cell membrane penetration The highly basic structure of the C-Terminal domain of RELN and its ability to interact with membranes might make this domain suitable to induce cell membrane penetration of other proteins (as in protein fusion or as mixture) or nucleic acids (like mRNA). To evaluate this, HMRECs were cultured in a 24 well plate until 80% confluency complete endothelial growth media 2 (EGM-2, Lonza, Switzerland). For the treatments, 5 ug of mRNA were added to all the formulations. We prepared mRNA/peptide conjugates by mixing each amount of peptide (RKQNYMMNFSRQHGLRHFYNRRRR) and mRNA prior to dilution in EGM-2. HMRECs were cultured with treatment media for 24 hours followed by fluorescence measurements in a microplate reader Synergy H1 (Biotek, VT) upon exciting at 482 nm and recording emission at 520 nm. The results, shown in FIG.16, showed an increase in expression when the mRNA was mixed with the CTR. Example 9.

Analysis of miniRELN constructs in HREC cells Both in vitro overexpression and recombinant proteins were used to evaluate mini-RELN constructs in human retinal endothelial cells (HREC). The constructs used in Examples 10-12 were as shown in Table 5. TABLE 5. Exemplary constructs For in vitro overexpression, the HRECs were cultured in EBM-2 media enriched with EGM-2 Single Quots (Lonza) at 37°C and 5% CO2 and experimentally tested at passage 7.24h prior experiment, cells were plated on a 6-well plate at 500,000 cells/mL. The cell transfection of plasmids was done with Lipofectamine 2000 (5 µL, Life technologies) according to the manufacturer. In detail, one day prior to transfection, cells were seeded to be 70% confluent at moment of transfection. The day of transfection lipofectamine was diluted and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, to allow the formation of the lipophilic complex. Subsequently, each plasmid (1 µg, Invivogen) was added to the lipid complex of Lipofectamine and incubated for 10 minutes. We used OPTIMEM media (Gibco) to block the transfection after 5 hours, to allow cells to recover and facilitate replication. Prior 5 h and 24h post-transfection, cells were imaged using 10X magnification light microscope (Olympus CKX53). The results, shown in FIGs.17A-J, demonstrated integrity of mammalian cells expressing all mini-RELN constructs. 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for western blotting analysis. Total protein levels were quantified via BCA assay. For Western Blotting, 7 µg protein homogenates were prepared under reducing and denaturing conditions using Laemmli buffer enriched with 10 mM DTT and 5 min boiling. Samples were electrophoretically separated in a 4–20% Gel at 90V and protein transferred to a PVDF membrane using iBlotTM 2 Dry Blotting System. The membrane was blocked using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer for 2 hours. We detected β-actin (1:5000, mouse, #66009-1-Ig, Proteintech), and total DAB1(1:100, SC-red tube; sc-271136 Dab1 (G-5), Santa Cruz). Antibodies were diluted using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer and incubated overnight at 4C under gentle shaking. Prior to secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washed 2 times using TBS-T for 10 minutes. As secondary antibodies, we used IR Dye 800n CW Goat-anti-Rabbit (925- 32211, Licor), IR Dye 680 CW Goat-anti-Mouse (925-68070, Licor) both diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer and HRP (m-IgG1 BP-HRP-SC-525408, Santa Cruz) diluted 1:1000 also in blocking buffer. for 1 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T prior IR detection using Odyssey imager. To quantify the results, each band was quantified using ImageJ and data expressed as DAB1:β-actin ratio normalized to the control. FIGs.18A-E, showed a reduction in total Dab1 presumably as a result of increased signaling activity of Dab1 triggered by mini-RELN constructs. The reduction of total DAB1 was quantified as shown in FIGs 19A-E. These experiments showed that the mini-RELN constructs could function directly in cells that express them. The results, shown in FIGs.18A-E, demonstrate that expression of the mini-RELN constructs triggers sustained activation of RELN signaling detected as significant turnover and reduction of total DAB1. Data is showing reduced levels of DAB1 in the presence of the mini- RELN constructs as compared to lipofectamine (Lp) for all constructs. These findings allowed us to conclude that all mini RELN constructs tested were active. All the tested constructs triggered significant activation, with 225Z being the most active.225Z include the CR50 domain of RELN to induce oligomerization, R5- 6 to bind the receptors, and the RELN C-term with the COLBOS variant to bind HSPGs. Our analyses showed that the modular design described herein was effective at activating RELN signaling also when including RAP to bind the receptor, Fc to induce oligomers, and RELN C-term with the COLBOS variant to bind HSPGs. In this design Fc replaced CR50 of RELN and RAP replaced the receptor binding domain. In this design miniRELN constructs are shown to be efficacious when produced by a cell like HREC and signal in the same cell in an autocrine fashion. The experimental evidence showing that we can replace modules within the mini-RELN domain according to their function (e.g., Fc vs. CR-50 and RAP vs. R5-6) without compromising efficacy demonstrates that our chosen modules are sufficient to support RELN signaling. For in vitro screening of constructs using recombinant mini-RELN on HRECs, the cells were cultured in EBM-2 media enriched with EGM-2 Single Quots (Lonza) at 37°C and 5% CO2 and experimentally tested at passage 7.24h prior experiment, cells were plated on a 6-well plate at 500,000 cells/mL. Two hours before the experiment, the cells were washed with PBS to remove residual growth media and then incubated with a starving media including EBM-2, 1% GlutaMax + 0,2% Normicin. Treatments was conducted using recombinant mini RELN constructs obtained from Innovagen and Recombinant Mouse Reelin Protein from R&D systems (3820-MR-025/CF). Each treatment was incubated for 5 minutes at 4ug/mL concentration and cells were subsequently harvested in lysis buffer was applied constituted of RIPA (Cell signaling), proteases inhibitors (cOmplete™, Mini, EDTA- free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche), phosphatases inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche), 1 uL of proteasome inhibitor MG-13210mM, 1% Triton X 100. The lysates were scraped and centrifugated at 15000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Total protein levels were quantified via BCA assay. For Western Blotting, 3.5ug protein homogenates were prepared under reducing and denaturing conditions using Laemmli buffer enriched with 10 mM DTT and 5 min boiling. Samples were electrophoretically separated in a 4–20% Gel at 90V and protein transferred to a PVDF membrane using iBlotTM 2 Dry Blotting System. The membrane was blocked using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer for 2 hours. We detected pDAB1 (Tyr232; 1:1000, rabbit, #3325 Cell signaling), and total protein staining (Licor). Antibodies were diluted using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer and incubated overnight at 4C under gentle shaking. Prior secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washed 2 times using TBS-T for 10 minutes. As secondary antibodies we used IR Dye 800n CW Goat-anti-Rabbit (925-32211, Licor) diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. Membranes were washed three times with TBST-T prior IR detection using Odyssey imager. To quantify the results, each band was quantified using ImageJ and data expressed as pDAB1:total protein ratio normalized to the control. RELN triggered phosphorylation and proteosomal degradation of Dab1. FIGs 20A-F showed increased levels of phosphorylated DAB1 (pDAB1) after treatment with the mini-RELN purified constructs. pDAB1 levels were quantified in FIGs 21A- E. These experiments show that the mini-RELN constructs also work in a non-cell autonomous manner. As seen in FIG.21A, increased pDAB1 levels upon 225Q treatment. rmRELN lacking the C-term of RELN (rmRELN) was inferior in efficacy compared to 225Q, which contained C-term RELN with the COLBOS variant. This finding suggests that a module containing the C-term of RELN or a GAG binding domain is useful for optimal RELN signaling. Signaling by miniRELN was measured by directly detecting phosphorylated Dab1 (pDab1) after short term treatment. In this design the miniRELN peptides are shown to work when produced by some cells like HEK and signal in other cells like HREC. FIG.21B shows increased pDAB1 levels upon treatment with 225S and 225T mini-RELN constructs.225T containing Fc for oligomerization, RAP for binding to receptors, and the C-term domain of RELN with the COLBOS variant was more effective than controls that were larger and lacked the C-term RELN domain with the COLBOS variant (rmRELN mouse and human at much higher concentrations including R3-6 of RELN). This confirms the conclusion of the superiority of constructs containing a GAG binding domain like the C-term domain of RELN with the COLBOS variant. FIG.21C shows increased levels of pDAB1 in the presence of the mini-RELN constructs of various configurations as compared vehicle; 225Z including CR50, R5-6 of RELN and C-Term of RELN with COLBOS variant was more effective than commercially available positive control lacking a GAG binding domain and lacking an oligomerization domain. Data in FIG. 21D shows increased pDAB1 levels upon treatment with 225SV, 225SW and 225Z. This experiment showed that a miniRELN construct like 225Z including only CR50, R5-6 and the C-term of RELN with the COLBOS variant was more effective at triggering signaling compared to full-length RELN WT and full-length RELN COLBOS. This data demonstrates the mini-RELN constructs are more effective than full-length RELN even when the full-length RELN has the COLBOS variant. FIG. 21E, data showing increased pDAB1 levels upon treatment with 225Z. As shown in FIG.21F, as expected for constructs that only contain Fc for oligomerization and the C-term of RELN but lack the receptor binding domain, there was no detectable increase in RELN signaling. Therefore, the presence of the receptor binding domain is necessary to activate RELN signaling. In sum, these results provide evidence that the functional modules that we described in Table A are both necessary and sufficient to stimulate optimal RELN signaling with a therapeutic intent. Depending on the indication for instance if more or less RELN signaling supplementation is required or depending on the particular route of administration a particular mini-RELN may be more appropriate. For instance, smaller mini-RELN constructs may be preferred for the transnasal delivery. A lactate dehydrogenase assay was performed in SH-SY5Y cells treated 24 h with pre-formed oligomeric Tau (oTau) either alone or in the presence of C-term RELN WT (184I). The lactate dehydrogenase assay was performed as follows.100k neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y, ATCC) cells/ well were plated in 96-well TC treated plates in growth media (DMEM/F12, Gibco, 10% heat-inactivated FBS, R&D, 200ug normocin) and allowed to attach and grow overnight. Next day, test compounds were allowed to thaw on wet ice. Phenol-free and serum free DMEM/F12 no serum no antibiotic media was warmed and a 50mL aliquot was sterile filtered (0.22um) as test media. In TC cabinet, thawed test compounds were mixed via pipetting then added to final concentration for each test condition in filtered test media and mixed through pipetting. Test conditions were allowed to pre-incubate for 15mins at RT in TC cabinet. Wells were gently aspirated and gently washed with 200uL prewarmed Test media, then gently aspirated and 100uL of test conditions were added and allowed to incubate in TC incubator at 5%CO2 for 21hrs. LDH performed using Roche kit according to manufacturer’s protocol. The results, seen in FIG.23, showed a reduction of oTau-derived cytotoxicity in the presence of 184I, thus suggesting a direct interaction with neurotoxic oligomeric tau aggregates.184I did not show any cytotoxicity. These results suggest a mechanism for direct protection against tau toxicity mediated by a miniRELN construct. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is proposed that this mechanism does not involve RELN signaling, but is a direct effect mediated via binding of Cterm RELN and tau. A Thioflavin T (ThT) assay was also performed using synthetic Reelin peptides to assess the differential effects of these proteins on Aβ42 aggregation in vitro using Thioflavin T (SensoLyte ThT β-Amyloid (1-42) Aggregation kit, catalog no. AS-72214). Aβ42 was added to a final concentration of 55 μM in solutions of 10 μM of Reelin peptide variants in a transparent, no-binding 96-well plate. Samples were then mixed with 2 mM Thioflavin T dye and fluorescence was read at excitation wavelength/emission wavelength (Ex/Em) = 440/484 nm at intermittent time intervals over 2 h. The plate was kept at 37 °C with 15 s shaking between reads. The results, shown in FIGs.24A-C, showed that the Cterm domain of RELN with and without the COLBOS variant reduced amyloid aggregation. The presence of the COLBOS variant enhanced this effect. In general, it appears that the RELN Cterm domain is highly unstructured. Interactions with tau and/or amyloid and/or HSPGs may allow RELN to assume more stable configurations leading to anti-aggregation properties. These data suggest that so as long as a mini-RELN construct contains the C-term domain of RELN, preferably with the COLBOS variant, it could have protective effects. If the mini-RELN includes the C-term domain only without a receptor binding domain then the protection will not involve signaling, but will still involve direct interactions with tau. If the mini-RELN includes the C-term domain and the receptor binding domain, it will have at least two protective mechanisms, namely RELN signaling and direct interactions with tau. HEK-derived constructs were tested for overexpression whenever antibodies were available using Western blotting as follows.15 µg protein homogenates were prepared using Laemmli. Samples were electrophoretically separated in a 4–20% Gel at 90V and protein transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using 20 % Methanol tris-glycine transfer buffer. The membrane was blocked using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer for 2 hours. We detected anti Fc-taf (1:1,000, goat, Sigma Aldrich), GAPDH (1:5000, mouse, Abcam). Antibodies were diluted using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer and incubated overnight at 4C under gentle shaking. Prior to secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washed 2 times using TBS-T for 10 minutes. As secondary antibodies, we used IR Dye 800n CW Goat-anti-Rabbit (925- 32211, Licor), IR Dye 680 CW Goat-anti-Mouse (925-68070, Licor) both diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer and HRP (; m-IgG1 BP-HRP-SC-525408, Santa Cruz) diluted 1:1000 also in blocking buffer. for 1 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T prior IR detection using Odyssey imager. To quantify the results, each band was quantified using ImageJ and data expressed as pDAB1:β-actin ratio normalized to the control. The results, presented in FIGs.25A-B, provide evidence of protein expression. For 225R, which includes the CR50 domain of RELN, higher molecular weight bands representing miniRELN oligomers were detected (25A-B). Mini-RELN constructs including Fc from IgGs are expected to form oligomers whereas constructs including CR50 and fspCR50 are expected to form higher molecular weight multimers. The effect of in vitro treatment with RELN or miniRELN protein was also evaluated. HRECs were cultured in EBM-2 media enriched with EGM-2 Single Quots (Lonza) at 37°C and 5% CO2 and experimentally tested at passage 7. 24h prior experiment, cells were plated on a 6-well plate at 500,000 cells/mL. Two hours before the experiment, the cells were washed with PBS to remove residual growth media and then incubated with a starving media including EBM-2, 1% GlutaMax + 0,2% Normicin. Treatments was conducted using media derived from HEK 293T cells transiently transfected for 24h with different mini-RELN constructs in the presence of Lipofectamine 2000. HEK-derived Lipofectamine2000-media was used as negative control. HEK 293T-derived media was tested at different ratio 1:1, 1:4, and 1:14 (Transfected media : Starving media). Each treatment was incubated for 5 minutes and cells were subsequently harvested in lysis buffer was applied constituted of RIPA (Cell signaling), proteases inhibitors (cOmplete™, Mini, EDTA- free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche), phosphatases inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche), 1 uL of proteasome inhibitor MG-13210mM, 1% Triton X 100. The lysates were scraped and centrifugated at 15000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C. Total protein levels were quantified via BCA assay. For Western Blotting, 7ug protein homogenates were prepared under reducing and denaturing conditions using Laemmli buffer enriched with 10 mM DTT and 5 min boiling. Samples were electrophoretically separated in a 4–20% Gel at 90V and protein transferred to a PVDF membrane using iBlotTM 2 Dry Blotting System. The membrane was blocked using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer for 2 hours. We detected pDAB1 (Tyr232; 1:1000, rabbit, #3325 Cell signaling), and Beta actin (1:5000, mouse, #66009-1-Ig, Proteintech. Antibodies were diluted using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer and incubated overnight at 4C under gentle shaking. Prior secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washes 2 times using TBS-T for 10 minutes. As secondary antibodies we used IR Dye 800n CW Goat-anti-Rabbit (925-32211, Licor) and IR Dye 680 CW Goat-anti-Mouse (925- 68070, Licor) both diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T prior IR detection using Odyssey imager. To quantify the results, each band was quantified using ImageJ and data expressed as pDAB1:βActin ratio normalized to the control. Transient overexpression of mini-RELN constructs in HEK 293T was obtained as follows. HEK T293Cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, R&D) and 400 uL/L normocine at 37°C and 5% CO2 and experimentally used up to 10 passages.24h prior experiment, cells were plated on a 6-well plate at 300,000 cells/mL. The cell transfection of plasmids was done with Lipofectamine 2000 (7 mL, Life technologies,) according to the manufacturer. In detail, one day prior to transfection, cells were seeded to be 70% confluent at moment of transfection. The day of transfection lipofectamine was diluted and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, to allow the formation of the lipophilic complex. Subsequently, each plasmid (3mg, Invivogen) was added to the lipid complex of Lipofectamine and incubated for 10 minutes. We used OPTIMEM media (Gibco) to block the transfection after 5 Hours, to allow cells to recover and facilitate replication.24 H post-transfection, cells were harvested, and media cleared from cells by centrifugation and stored under aseptic conditions at -80 until use. Prior, 5 h and 24h post-transfection, cells were imaged using 10X magnification light microscope (Olympus CKX53). FIGs.26A and 27A show that miniRELN constructs containing Fc to induce oligomerization, APOE to bind the receptors, and C-TermRELN to bind HSPGs were capable of activating RELN signaling better than a commercially available construct containing only RELN R5-6. As expected 225Yf which includes WT APOE, expected to bind the receptors more efficiently, is more efficacious and clearly dose dependent. 225Xf including APOE with the Christchurch mutation is also effective at activating signaling. The results shown in FIGs.26B and 27B upon treatment with 225ZZ might be related to the expected property of this construct to oligomerize. FIGs.26C and 27C show efficacy for 225SU and 225SV miniRELN constructs. FIGs.26D and 27D show efficacy for miniRELN constructs 225SW and 233F; 233F includes two RELN R6 domains in tandem, a construct that is not naturally occurring. FIGs.26E and 27E show Dab1 signaling activation with 225RR construct including RELN Cterm with the COLBOS variant, which was more robust compared to controls and compared to 233A, which includes RELN Cterm WT. Example 11. In vivo validation of purified recombinant mini-RELN constructs We used a MIND procure (trans nasal delivery using Minimally Invasive Nasal Depot (MIND), Padmakumar et al., J Control Release.2021 Mar 10; 331: 176– 186) or intraperitoneal injection to administer miniRELN constructs into mice. MIND leverages the olfactory nerve to bypass the blood brain barrier. Our clinical studies showed the importance of the entorhinal cortex in extreme protection against Alzheimer’s. Using the MIND methodology provides one method of reaching the entorhinal cortex with minimal systemic exposure. We showed it is possible to deliver miniRELN to the hippocampal formation, including the entorhinal cortex, which we showed is a region of the brain critical for extreme protection against Alzheimer’s. C57Bl/3 (Jackson Laboratory) were housed under regular light/night cycle. All procedures were conducted under approved IACUC animal protocols. Prior to incision, the nasal region was shaved and cleaned using betadine and 70% alcohol and mouse subcutaneously injected with buprenorphine HCl and meloxicam (5 mg/kg). The nasal cavity was then opened using a scalped and nasal mucosa exposed using a microdrill. Once the mucosa was exposed, gel dispersion of either PBS or mini-RELN constructs (Innovagen) in 20% Pluronic (Sigma Aldrich) was subcutaneously delivered in the surgically-generated pocket. Mice were injected with meloxicam for 3 days prior euthanasia at day 4 to collect the brain tissue used for post-mortem analysis. Western blotting was performed as follows.20 ug protein homogenates were prepared under reducing and denaturing conditions using Laemmli buffer enriched with 10 mM DTT and 5 min boiling. Samples were electrophoretically separated in a 4–20% Gel at 90V and protein transferred to a PVDF membrane using iBlotTM 2 Dry Blotting System. The membrane was blocked using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer for 2 hours. We detected pDAB1 (Tyr232; 1:1000, rabbit, #3325 Cell signaling), and Beta actin (1:5000, mouse, #66009-1-Ig, Proteintech). Antibodies were diluted using Intercept® (TBS) Blocking Buffer and incubated overnight at 4C under gentle shaking. Prior secondary antibody incubation, membranes were washes 2 times using TBS-T for 10 minutes. As secondary antibodies we used IR Dye 800n CW Goat-anti-Rabbit (925-32211, Licor) and IR Dye 680 CW Goat-anti-Mouse (925- 68070, Licor) both diluted 1:10000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature under gentle shaking. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T prior IR detection using Odyssey imager. To quantify the results, each band was quantified using ImageJ and data expressed as pDAB1:βActin ratio normalized to the control. The data, shown in Figures 28A-K, demonstrated effective brain delivery of a miniRELN peptide to both the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex and to the midbrain, leading to increased levels of downstream RELN pathway as confirmed by increased pDAB1 levels. Mice treated with the miniRELN construct have more RELN signaling in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex as determined by increased pDab1. The efficacy of the miniRELN treatment was confirmed in WT mice and in mice with a tau mutation leading to tauopathy.225Z includes CR50 of RELN to induce oligomerization, R5-6 of RELN to mediate receptor binding, and Cterm RELN with the COLBOS mutation to achieve HSPG binding. This shows that these RELN domains were sufficient to drive protective signaling. Immunofluorescence staining of murine brains was also used to demonstrate delivery of miniRELN using MIND.24 or 72 hours after Mini Reelin (225S) or vehicle administration, mice were intracardially perfused with 4% PFA in PBS and brains were harvested and incubated in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 24 hours. Sagittal sections were obtained at 1 mm thickness using a stainless-steel brain matrix. The entorhinal- hippocampal section of each brain was chosen for Clarity using Binaree® Tissue Clearing™ Kit (HRTC-012) following the kit guidelines. Sections were incubated with IgG-Fc tag and pDAB1 primary antibodies for 72 h followed by secondary antibody: Alexa 488 and Alexa 647, and DAPI for 1 h. Subsequently, sections were imaged using confocal SP8 microscope for quantification. The results (exemplary results for construct 225S shown in FIGs.29A-B) demonstrated the presence of the miniRELN peptide in the brain that was colocalized with brain cells with increased levels of pDab1. This is proof of effective drug delivery, target engagement, and targeted RELN signaling activation, in the hippocampal formation. Example 12. Systemic delivery of mini-RELN reduced tau pathology in P301S Tau mice. The effects of systemic delivery of mini-RELN peptides was evaluated in vivo. 6 months old female MAPT P301S Tau Tg mice were injected intraperitoneally on day 1 with 500 µL and on day 2-4 with 250 µL solutions of either vehicle (PBS) or mini-RELN peptides. On Day 5, mice were euthanized with saturating concentration CO2 gas and intracardially perfused with 4% PFA. Brains were subsequently harvested and used for histological analyses. Immunofluorescence staining of murine brains was performed as follows.24 hours post fixation with 4% PFA at 4 °C, sagittal brain sections were obtained at 1 mm thickness using a stainless-steel brain matrix. The entorhinal-hippocampal section of each brain was chosen for Clarity using Binaree® Tissue Clearing™ Kit (HRTC- 012) following the kit guidelines. Sections were incubated with pTauS396 primary antibody for 72 h followed by secondary antibody: Alexa 647, and DAPI for 1 h. Subsequently, sections were imaged using confocal SP8 microscope for quantification. Fourteen images were taken at 63X magnification per group. Fluorescence intensity of pTau was quantified automatically using Matlab (2021a). Otsu’s thresholding method was used to get a mask of the image signal and then the mean intensity of the signal was computed. Quantification of pTau S396 fluorescence intensity was used as a hallmark of tau pathology. The results, shown in FIG.30, showed that pTau S396 levels were significantly reduced when mice were treated with the mini-RELN peptide. This data shows that administration of the miniRELN construct is efficacious when administered systemically, and that the beneficial effect results in significant reduction of tau phosphorylation, a pathological feature of tauopathies like frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. This was shown in a mouse model of tauopathy (MAPT P301S). References 1. Acosta-Baena N, Sepulveda-Falla D, Lopera-Gomez CM, Jaramillo- Elorza MC, Moreno S, Aguirre-Acevedo DC, et al.
