#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention provides an application of a reagent for detecting an ABCG8 mutant gene in the preparation of a kit for detecting a patient or carrier of sitosterolemia type 1. In the above application, the ABCG8 mutant gene includes c.892C>T and/or c.490C>T. The present invention can solve the problem that the detection of sitosterolemia type 1 in the prior art cannot meet clinical needs, and is applicable to the field of ABCG8 mutant gene detection."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses reagents, primers, probes, kits, and gene chips for detecting specific ABCG8 gene mutations involved in sitosterolemia type 1 (notably c.892C>T and c.490C>T).  
- It focuses on genetic diagnostic methods based on PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, and gene chip hybridization for identifying known pathogenic mutations to enable disease diagnosis and carrier screening.  
- The technology explicitly relates to detecting homozygous or compound heterozygous states in an autosomal recessive disease context, confirming presence or absence of specific pathogenic variants.  
- Disease diagnosis is based on detecting mutations (presence/absence) at defined nucleotide positions.

#### Key Differences

- The patent does **not** describe or claim any method for integrating population-based prior probabilities or variant frequencies to estimate disease likelihood.  
- It does **not** introduce Bayesian inference combining prior genetic model probabilities with observed variant calls or false negative rates to produce posterior probabilities of diagnosis.  
- No mention or use of true positive (TP), false negative (FN), true negative (TN), or false positive (FP) modeling is included.  
- The technical focus is on molecular detection of specific mutations via PCR and probes rather than probabilistic genome-wide variant interpretation.  
- It aims to detect mutations for sitosterolemia type 1 only, not to provide confidence intervals or quantify overall genome-wide diagnostic certainty.  
- Does not address modeling of entire genotype landscapes or inheritance mode probabilistic summaries as in Quant.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

This patent’s scope strictly covers reagents, primers, probes, and kits for detecting specifically defined ABCG8 mutations via conventional molecular biology methods. It lacks any overlapping concept of integrating population genetics priors with patient-level variant observation data to quantitatively infer diagnostic probabilities, which is central to Quant’s novelty. Hence, despite similar terminology around genetic variant detection, the core theoretical concepts and technical implementations differ significantly.
