#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure provides a method for genetic analysis for disease diagnoses, as well as a system for implementing such analysis. Provided is a comprehensive, scalable, biotechnology solution that solves diagnostic and therapeutic complications in rapidly progressive childhood genetic diseases. As such, the invention provides Genome-to-Treatment (GTRxSM), which is an automated, virtual system for genetic disease diagnosis and acute management guidance."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Extraction of a phenome from electronic medical records employing clinical natural language processing (CNLP) to generate standardized phenotype vocabularies (e.g., HPO terms).
- Generating ranked lists of potential differential diagnoses based on integration of clinical phenotypes and genetic variant data.
- Use of rapid genome sequencing (rWGS) and rapid exome sequencing (rWES) for genetic variant detection.
- Annotation and classification of genetic variants (VUS, pathogenic, likely pathogenic), including allele frequency filtering.
- Algorithmic ranking of candidate diagnoses by phenotype–genotype correlation.
- Automation of the pipeline from sample to provisional genetic diagnosis, including automatic data transfer and analysis.
- Incorporation of both nucleotide variants and structural/copy number variants (SVs/CNVs).
- Creation of a virtual acute management guidance system linking provisional diagnoses to specific therapeutic options.
- Use of expert-curated databases for disease, gene, and treatment information.
- Provision of user-friendly report generation including rank-ordered diagnoses and treatment recommendations.
- Use of Bayesian or probabilistic models (e.g., MOONTM) including scoring phenotype-disease overlap.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on diagnosis and management guidance workflows and infrastructure for acute genetic disease management in pediatric intensive care, not on genome-wide calculation of prior probabilities or explicit Bayesian modeling of true positive/false negative variant observations per gene.
- Although Bayesian models are mentioned (MOON’s ranking), the core method concentrates on annotation, ranking, and clinical reporting rather than on genome-wide estimation of probability of observing disease-causing variants under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and explicitly integrating unobserved variant data (e.g. false negatives).
- Does not describe integration of genome-wide prior probabilities with observed or missing variant data in a Bayesian framework to quantify a posterior probability of a full genetic diagnosis with credible intervals.
- Phenotype extraction and variant interpretation are focused on identifying candidate diagnoses rather than estimating confidence of a *complete* diagnosis considering false negative probabilities.
- Treatment guidance is a major novel focus here, which is not within Quant’s core function.
- Use of external databases for variant pathogenicity and disease phenotypes is common but not specialized for the novel prior-posterior probability framework.
- The described approach prioritizes ranking diagnostic candidates rather than quantifying diagnostic certainty probabilistically across the genome.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

### Summary

The patent CA3221980A1 discloses a comprehensive automated system and method for rapid diagnosis and management of genetic diseases in acutely ill children using rapid genome/exome sequencing, phenotype extraction by CNLP, variant annotation, and ranking of candidate diagnoses with associated treatment recommendations.

While it employs Bayesian models for variant ranking and integrates genotype and phenotype data, it does *not* disclose or claim:

- A genome-wide calculation of prior probabilities of observing disease-causing variants per gene under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
- Explicit modeling of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) variant observations to compute posterior probabilities of a *complete* genetic diagnosis.
- Quantification of diagnostic uncertainty via credible intervals integrating both observed and unobserved (missing) variant data.
- A probabilistic framework for the confidence of genetic diagnosis beyond generating ranked variant lists.

Thus, although superficially related in terms of using rWGS data, phenotypic standardized vocabularies, genetic variant annotation, and Bayesian ranking, the underlying theoretical framework and technical innovation of Quant—to explicitly quantify genome-wide prior and posterior probabilities integrating false negative probabilities—is not disclosed or claimed here. The focus on treatment guidance and acute management also distinguishes this patent from the purely variant-diagnosis confidence quantification goal of Quant.

Therefore, this patent does not block Quant’s freedom to operate.
