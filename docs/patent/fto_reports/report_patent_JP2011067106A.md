#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "CHST14 gene is found out to be the responsible gene of the new-type EDS by the homozygous mapping and the mutational analysis of candidate genes ... The disease is autosomal recessive inheritance, and the patient has a mutation of the CHST14 gene as a homo bond or a composite hetero bond. The EDS patient and the gene carrier can be detected by using the mutation of the CHST14 gene as an index."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses methods for detecting mutations in the CHST14 gene associated with a newly identified autosomal recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).
- It focuses on homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations in CHST14 as diagnostic markers.
- The method involves direct sequencing of genomic DNA to identify missense or nonsense mutations in CHST14.
- It uses genetic and linkage analysis to narrow down candidate regions and identify causal mutations.
- The patent covers diagnostic testing based on identifying presence or absence of specific disease-causing mutations to detect patients or carriers.

#### Key Differences

- The patent is strictly focused on a single gene (CHST14) and its mutations causing one specific Mendelian disease (a new type of EDS).
- It does not describe or claim methods that calculate or integrate prior probabilities of pathogenic variants at a genome-wide scale.
- There is no disclosure or suggestion of quantifying false negatives, nor computing Bayesian posterior probabilities for a complete genetic diagnosis.
- The method does not integrate multiple variant calls or broader population allele frequencies, nor inheritance modes beyond simple homozygous/heterozygous mutation detection.
- It is not focused on genome-wide variant probability or diagnostic confidence intervals.
- The approach is a classical genetic diagnosis by detecting mutations in one gene, without variant scoring or probabilistic modeling components central to Quant.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** This patent concerns single-gene mutation detection for a specific rare disease without addressing or resembling the core innovation of Quant, which is genome-wide prior probability estimation, integration of observed/missing variant data, false negative modeling, and Bayesian posterior probability calculation of genetic diagnoses. The technical approaches differ fundamentally.
