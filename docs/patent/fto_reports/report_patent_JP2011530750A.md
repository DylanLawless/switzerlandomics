#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure provides a method and system for individual action planning based on an individual's genomic profile. The method includes assessing a relationship between an individual's genotype and at least one disease or condition and providing an assessment system for the individual's action plan."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent analyze an individual's genomic profile to assess risk related to diseases.
- The patent describes generating personalized phenotype profiles and action plans integrating genomic data.
- The patent mentions using genotype-phenotype correlations and risk assessments such as Genetic Composite Index (GCI) or GCI Plus scores.
- Use of public databases and genotype frequency statistics, statistical models to assess relative risks and produce risk scores related to diseases.
- The patent also discloses generating an overall risk assessment or personalized action plan that includes recommendations on lifestyle, medical treatments, diet, exercise, etc.
- The action plans are personalized using genotype-based risk scores and can include motivation/incentives to improve health.
- Bayesian and statistical modeling of genotype-disease associations and calculation of relative risk or odds ratios is described.
- Reporting of probabilistic risk estimates and credible intervals is consistent with Quant’s approach.
- The patent extensively references use of true/false positives, relative risk (RR), odds ratios (OR), likelihood ratios, and quantitative risk modeling.
- Recommendations are scored and presented with graded (color/number/letter) schemes, categorical groupings, and updateable reports.
- Genomic profile acquisition via microarrays, PCR, sequencing, data storage, and digital processing pipelines are described similarly.

#### Key Differences

- This patent primarily focuses on generating personalized action plans and assessments for healthy lifestyle or disease risk reduction, incorporating genomic risk scores.
- While many concepts overlap (use of GCI scores, genotype-disease risk probability, phenotype profiles), it emphasizes behavioral recommendations and motivating individuals with incentives.
- Quant’s core novelty lies in Bayesian integration of prior probabilities of pathogenic variants, modeling true/false positives and negatives specifically to generate a **posterior probability of complete genetic diagnosis** with credible intervals, not only risk scoring or behavioral action plans.
- Quant uniquely models uncertain or missing variant data (false negatives) and diagnostic confidence at the whole-genome level across inheritance modes, which is not explicitly claimed or discussed in this patent.
- This patent describes relative risk and odds ratio calculations primarily associated with SNPs for risk prediction, rather than a general Bayesian framework that accounts for variant observation probabilities and diagnostic certainty.
- While the patent uses GCI and GCI Plus scores, it appears more oriented toward risk prediction and personalized lifestyle/medical recommendations, rather than the diagnostic certainty quantification that distinguishes Quant.
- No explicit mention or claim of integrating true positive, false negative probabilities at variant/gene/patient level to compute a posterior probability of a complete molecular diagnosis.
- No detailed disclosure concerning credible intervals for uncertainty quantification analogous to Quant’s unique feature.
- The patent’s focus is broader lifestyle and health motivation, not freedom-to-operate for the specific Bayesian diagnosis confidence framework of Quant.

#### Conclusion

Potential overlap — recommend legal review.

**Summary:**  
This Japanese patent significantly overlaps with Quant in usage of genomic profiles for risk scoring, phenotypic profiling, use of GCI/GCI Plus, and personalized action plans. However, it does not clearly teach or claim the unique Bayesian modeling of true positives, false negatives, and posterior probabilities of complete genetic diagnosis, which is Quant’s core novelty. The risk scoring and behavioral recommendation focus differs from Quant’s diagnostic probability framework. Due to strong technical resemblance in variant scoring, disease risk assessment, and personalized recommendations, the patent may pose potential FTO issues, meriting further legal review.
