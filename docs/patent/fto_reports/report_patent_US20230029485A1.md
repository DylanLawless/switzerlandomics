#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "One or more computer-implemented methods of using molecular dynamics simulations combined with machine learning to define the ensemble of genomic structures of variants to predict changes in drug and ligand binding."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses molecular dynamics simulations and machine learning to analyze genetic variants at the protein structural level.
- Applies phi and psi dihedral angles of amino acid backbones as features for machine learning classification.
- Predicts drug resistance or sensitivity by modeling variant protein structures and their binding affinities (e.g., BCL-2 variants with Venetoclax).
- Employs Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and random forest classifiers.
- Produces probabilistic classification of variant impact on drug binding with high accuracy (>90%).
- Uses structural distances and machine learning outputs to predict severity of resistance.
- Focuses on variant-level functional/phenotypic prediction using molecular simulation data, including detailed modeling of binding pocket changes.
- Incorporates extensive empirical data correlation (X-ray crystallography, surface plasmon resonance) to validate structural models.
- Description includes predictive models tailored to specific proteins and drugs (e.g., BCL-2 / Venetoclax relationship).
- Also applies to peptide candidates for viral drug targets (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp16 interface).

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on *predicting individual variant effects on drug binding and drug resistance* by molecular simulation and machine learning.
- Does not disclose or claim genome-wide prior probability calculations of pathogenic variant occurrence.
- No explicit integration of population-level allele frequencies or gene-disease inheritance models (e.g., Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium priors).
- Does not address integration of observed/missing patient variant data to compute posterior probability of a **complete genetic diagnosis**.
- No use or modeling of diagnostic false negatives, true positives, false positives, and negative calls with Bayesian posterior inference.
- Does not output credible intervals reflecting diagnostic certainty or genome-wide diagnostic confidence.
- Does not aggregate variant-level data into gene-level diagnostic probabilities.
- The focus is on phenotype prediction per variant and drug resistance classification, rather than quantifying diagnostic confidence or disease-causal variant probability.
- Uses machine learning classifiers trained on simulation-derived features, but lacks Bayesian framework combining prior population/genetic knowledge with patient data.
- Application mainly in drug resistance prediction and peptide candidate identification, not clinical genetic diagnosis certainty assessment.
- No explicit mention of integrating public variant databases (gnomAD, ClinVar) or inheritance modes to generate priors.
- Uses molecular dynamics derived features for specific protein targets; Quant encompasses genome-wide variant analysis.
- Although confusion matrices, sensitivity, specificity metrics are used, they are for classifier performance, not clinical diagnostic posterior probabilities.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

### Overall Summary

This patent presents advanced computational methods combining molecular dynamics and machine learning to predict variant effects on drug response, specifically focusing on protein structure and drug binding changes. While overlapping in the use of molecular simulations, protein structural features (phi/psi angles), and machine learning for variant classification, it does **not** address or disclose:

- The calculation of genome-wide **prior probabilities** of pathogenic variants,
- Integration of **population variant frequencies and inheritance models** to inform priors,
- Bayesian posterior probability computation that combines **observed and unobserved (false negative) variant data** to express diagnostic confidence,
- Estimation of credible intervals quantifying diagnostic certainty,
- Gene-level aggregation of variant information for disease likelihood,
- Genome-wide diagnostic assessments rather than variant-level classifications.

Quant’s unique innovation lies in quantifying the overall likelihood that a patient harbors a disease-causing variant across all genes and modes of inheritance, explicitly modeling false negatives and producing probabilistic diagnostic confidence intervals—none of which are described or suggested in this patent. The patent's focus on drug resistance and phenotype prediction, using molecular dynamics and specific machine learning classifiers, is complementary but sufficiently different from Quant’s Bayesian diagnostic framework.

Therefore, there is no substantive blocking overlap with Quant’s technology. The mere use of Bayesian or machine learning methods for variant effect prediction, or use of phi/psi angles and molecular dynamics as features, does not infringe on Quant’s claims, which are centered on genome-wide diagnostic certainty modeling.
