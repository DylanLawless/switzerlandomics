### Description

Description SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR COMPLEX BIOMOLECULE SAMPLING AND BIOMARKER DISCOVERY CROSS-REFERENCE [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/661,388, filed April 23, 2018, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/824,281 filed March 26, 2019, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties for all purposes. BACKGROUND [0002] In the public domain, there are numerous references and well-curated databases that associate various biomolecules ( e.g ., protein) as biomarkers to many different diseases, disorders, and biological states. Advances in bioinformatics analyses offer new insights into the complex biomolecule changes that take place during the spectrum of health and disease. Yet the sensitivity and specificity of the identified biomarkers have not been adequate for early detection of cancers, for example. This may be attributed to the following; 1) often a single biomarker is not enough to generate sufficient signal to associate with a specific disease state, and 2) even if multiple biomarkers have been identified, classification using these biomarkers is often impaired due to noise from fluctuations in levels of these biomarkers and highly abundant serum/plasms proteins such as albumin. Several attempts have been made to enhance detection of a biomarker present at a low level, such as depletion of highly abundant proteins, isobaric labeling at the peptide level for multiplexed relative quantification, post-depletion plasma fractionation strategies, biomarker harvesting techniques, mathematical approaches for analyzing high quality data set, and multiplexed workflow. Despite all these efforts for improving the sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers, the complex biomolecule sampling has not been robustly successful in early detection of a disease state, e.g., cancer.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0023] The features of the present disclosure are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. A better understanding of the features and advantages of the present disclosure will be obtained by reference to the following detailed description that sets forth illustrative embodiments, in which the principles of the disclosure are utilized, and the accompanying drawings of which: [0024] FIG. 1 is an exemplary computer system for implementing a method described herein. [0025] FIG. 2 is a plot of the trained classification model. The lower right quadrant represents proteins that have a significant weight in the classification but with little existing knowledge associating the proteins to the specified disease. Therefore, these proteins are suitable candidates for novel biomarkers. The upper left quadrant represents proteins that have a large body of evidence linking them to the disease but weak classification weights. These proteins could represent either a common mechanism or set of mechanisms for multiple diseases which the classification weights cannot differentiate, or alternatively, could represent a weak role in the classification of the disease. The upper right and lower left quadrants help support the validity of the classification model. [0026] FIG. 3 is a bar graph of classification model weight, represents all 850+ proteins detected in the broad range proteome sampling, ordered in descending classification model weight. The top plot represents the top 50 proteins, and the bottom plot shows all 850+ proteins. The existing knowledge for association to disease is high if that protein is well associated to the disease through existing knowledge. Proteins with low existing knowledge for association to disease represent suitable candidates for potential biomarkers as they represent proteins with a significant classification weight but little existing knowledge. [0027] FIG. 4 is an image of a Corona Knowledge Map (CKM) user interface. The CKM is a relational database which categorizes surface-activity relationships between biomarkers captured and the particle which captured them, for example a corona, in order to optimize particle properties.

In suitable embodiments, the array comprises at least two to at least 100 sensor elements, alternatively at least two to at least 50 sensor elements, alternatively at least 2 to 30 sensor elements, alternatively at least 2 to 20 sensor elements, alternatively at least 2 to 10 sensor elements, alternatively at least 3 to at least 50 sensor elements, alternatively at least 3 to at least 30 sensor elements, alternatively at least 3 to at least 20 sensor elements, alternatively at least 3 to at least 10 sensor elements, alternatively at least 4 to at least 50 sensor elements, alternatively at least 4 to at least 30 sensor elements, alternatively at least 4 to at least 20 sensor elements, alternatively at least 4 to at least 10 sensor elements, and including any number of sensor elements contemplated in between (e.g., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 225, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, etc.). In some embodiments, the sensor array comprises at least 6 sensor elements to at least 20 sensor elements, alternatively at least 6 sensor elements to at least 10 sensor elements. [0043] As used herein, the term 'biomolecule corona' refers to the plurality of different biomolecules that are able to bind to a sensor element. The term 'biomolecule corona' encompasses 'protein corona' which is a term used in the art to refer to the proteins, lipids and other plasma components that bind nanoparticles when they come into contact with biological samples or biological system. For use herein, the term 'biomolecule corona' also encompasses both the soft and hard protein corona as referred to in the art, see, e.g., Milani et al. 'Reversible versus Irreversible Binding of Transferring to Polystyrene Nanoparticles: Soft and Hard Corona' ACS NANO, 2012, 6(3), pp. 2532-2541; Mirshafiee et al. 'Impact of protein pre-coating on the protein corona composition and nanoparticle cellular uptake' Biomaterials vol. 75, Jan 2016 pp. 295-304, Mahmoudi et al. 'Emerging understanding of the protein corona at the nanobio interfaces' Nanotoday 11(6) Dec. 2016, pp. 817-832, and Mahmoudi et al. 'Protein-Nanoparticle Interactions: Opportunities and Challenges' Chem. Rev., 2011, 111(9), pp. 5610-5637, the contents of which are incorporated by reference in their entireties. As described in the art, adsorption curve shows the build-up of a strongly bound monolayer up to the point of monolayer saturation (at a geometrically defined proteinto- NP ratio), beyond which a secondary, weakly bound layer is formed. While the first layer is irreversibly bound (hard corona), the secondary layer (soft corona) exhibits dynamic exchange. Proteins that adsorb with high affinity form what is known as the 'hard' corona, consisting of tightly bound proteins that do not readily desorb, and proteins that adsorb with low affinity form the 'soft' corona, consisting of loosely bound proteins. Soft and hard corona can also be defined based on their exchange times. Hard corona may show much larger exchange times in the order of several hours. See, e.g., M. Rahman et al. Protein-Nanoparticle Interactions, Spring Series in Biophysics 15, 2013, incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0044] The term 'biomolecule corona signature' refers to the composition, signature or pattern of different biomolecules that are bound to each separate sensor element. The signature not only refers to the different biomolecules but also the differences in the amount, level or quantity of the biomolecule bound to the sensor element, or differences in the conformational state of the biomolecule that is bound to the sensor element. It is contemplated that the biomolecule corona signatures of each sensor elements may contain some of the same biomolecules, may contain distinct biomolecules with regard to the other sensor elements, and/or may differ in level or quantity, type or confirmation of the biomolecule. The biomolecule corona signature may depend on not only the physiocochemical properties of the sensor element, but also the nature of the sample and the duration of exposure. In some cases, the biomolecule corona signature is a protein corona signature. In another case, the biomolecule corona signature is a polysaccharide corona signature. In yet another case, the biomolecule corona signature is a metabolite corona signature. In some cases, the biomolecule corona signature is a lipidomic corona signature. In some embodiments, the biomolecule corona signature comprises the biomolecules found in a soft corona and a hard corona. In some embodiments, the soft corona is a soft protein corona. In some embodiments, the hard corona is a hard protein corona. [0045] âPolypeptide(s)â,âpeptide(s)â and their grammatical equivalents as used herein refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. Polypeptides can comprise D-amino acids, L-amino acids, and non-natural amino acids, or any combination thereof. Aâmature proteinâ is a protein which is full-length and which, optionally, includes glycosylation or other modifications ( e.g ., post- translational modification) typical for the protein in a given cellular environment. A protein can be a monomer, a homodimer or a heteromultimer of polypeptides. Non-limiting examples of post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, acylation including acetylation and formylation, glycosylation (including N-linked and O-linked), amidation, hydroxylation, alkylation including methylation and ethylation, ubiquitylation, addition of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, formation of disulfide bridges, sulfation, myristoylation, palmitoylation, isoprenylation, famesylation, geranylation, glypiation, lipoylation and iodination. [0046] The termâlipid(s)â includes a variety of insoluble biomolecules, such as neutral fats, oils, and steroids. Lipids include simple lipids, triglycerides, eicosanoids, complex lipids, phospholipids, steroids, cholesterol, and lipid-related molecules. Simple lipids contain only two types of components, i.e., fatty acids and alcohols. Non-limiting examples of simple lipids include triglycerides, triacyl glycerol, di glycerides, and monoglycerides. Fatty acids are long chains of carbon and hydrogen each with a carboxyl acid functional group (-COOH) at one end. The chain length varies but most fatty acids possess even number of carbon atoms with sixteen or eighteen carbon fatty acids as the most common. Fatty acids can be saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated. Tri acyl glycerols or triglycerides form when glycerol links to three fatty acids, of which can be different chain lengths. Eicosanoids are modified fatty acids or lipid-related molecules produced by slight alterations in the fatty acid chain of arachidonic acid. Non-limiting examples of eicosanoids can include prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Complex lipids can comprise fatty acids, glycerol, and an alcohol besides glycerol, a carbohydrate and a phosphate group. Non-limiting examples of complex lipids include phospholipids and steroids. Phospholipids are phosphate containing lipid molecules. Steroids are a class of lipid-related molecules derived from cholesterol. Non limiting examples of steroids include cholesterol, testosterone, estrogen and cortisol. [0047] âPolynucleotideâ orâoligonucleotideâ as used herein refers to a polymeric form of nucleotides or nucleic acids of any length, either ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides. This term refers only to the primary structure of the molecule. Thus, this term includes double and single stranded DNA, triplex DNA, as well as double and single stranded RNA. It also includes modified, for example, by methylation and/or by capping, and unmodified forms of the polynucleotide. When a polynucleotide such as an oligonucleotide is represented by a sequence of letters, it is understood that the nucleotides are in 5â 3â order from left to right and that 'A' denotes deoxyadenosine, 'C' denotes deoxycytidine, 'G' denotes deoxyguanosine, and 'T' denotes thymidine, unless otherwise noted. The letters A, C, G, and T can be used to refer to the bases themselves, to nucleosides, or to nucleotides comprising the bases, as is standard in the art. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a chain of nucleotides comprising 4 types of nucleotides; A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine), and that RNA (ribonucleic acid) comprising 4 types of nucleotides; A, U (uracil), G, and C. DNA and RNA can also comprise synthetic nucleotides or chemically modified nucleotides. Certain pairs of nucleotides specifically bind to one another in a complementary fashion (called complementary base pairing). That is, adenine (A) can pair with thymine (T) (in the case of RNA, however, adenine (A) can pair with uracil (U)), and cytosine (C) can pair with guanine (G). When a first nucleic acid strand binds to a second nucleic acid strand made up of nucleotides that are complementary to those in the first strand, the two strands bind to form a double strand. [0048] As used herein, the termsâmarkerâ,âbiomarkerâ (or fragment thereof) and their synonyms, which are used interchangeably, refer to molecules that can be evaluated in a sample and are associated with a specified biological state. For example, markers include genes, expressed genes or their products ( e.g ., proteins) or autoantibodies to those proteins that can be detected from human samples, such as blood, serum, solid tissue, and the like, that is associated with a specified biological state. Such biomarkers include, but are not limited to, biomolecules comprising polynucleotides, amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, steroids, metabolites, polypeptides, proteins (such as, but not limited to, antigens and antibodies), carbohydrates, lipids, hormones, antibodies, regions of interest which serve as surrogates for biological molecules, combinations thereof (e.g., glycoproteins, ribonucleoproteins, lipoproteins) and any complexes involving any such biomolecules, such as, but not limited to, a complex formed between an antigen and an autoantibody that binds to an available epitope on said antigen. The biomarker can also refer to a portion of a polypeptide (parent) sequence that comprises at least 3 consecutive amino acid residues, at least 10 consecutive amino acid residues, at least 15 consecutive amino acid residues or more, and retains a biological activity and/or some functional characteristics of the parent polypeptide, e.g. antigenicity or structural domain characteristics. The biomarkers refer to both disease biomolecules present on or in diseased cells or those that have been shed from the diseased cells into bodily fluids such as blood or serum. The biomarkers can also refer to biomolecules, including autoantibodies produced by the body to those disease biomolecules. Biomarkers can include any biological substance indicative of the presence of disease, including but not limited to, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, glycomic or imaging biomarkers, in diseases such as cancer, immunological disorders, neurological disorders, endocrine disorders, metabolic disorders, cardiac diseases. Biomarkers can include molecules secreted by diseased cells and/or other cells, including gene, gene expression, and protein-based products (tumor markers or antigens, cell free DNA, mRNA, etc.) [0049] Byâfragmentâ is meant a portion of a polypeptide or nucleic acid molecule.

[0050] The termâisolatedâ and its grammatical equivalents as used herein refer to the removal of a biomolecule from its natural environment. The termâpurifiedâ and its grammatical equivalents as used herein refer to a molecule or composition, whether removed from nature (including genomic DNA and mRNA) or synthesized (including cDNA) and/or amplified under laboratory conditions, that has been increased in purity, whereinâpurityâ is a relative term, not âabsolute purity.â The termâsubstantially purifiedâ and its grammatical equivalents as used herein refer to a nucleic acid sequence, polypeptide, protein or other compound which is essentially free, i.e., is more than about 50% free of, more than about 60% free of, more than about 70% free of, more than about 80% free of, more than about 90% free of, the polynucleotides, proteins, polypeptides and other molecules that the nucleic acid, polypeptide, protein or other compound is naturally associated with.

[0053] Disease, condition, and disorder are used interchangeably herein. [0054] The termâproliferative diseaseâ as referred to herein refers to a unifying concept in which excessive proliferation of cells and/or turnover of cellular matrix contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of the disease, including cancer. [0055] Byâneoplasiaâ is meant any disease that is caused by or results in inappropriately high levels of cell division, inappropriately low levels of apoptosis, or both. In some embodiments, neoplasia is cancer or tumor. [0056] The termâcancerâ and 'tumor' as used herein interchangeably and are meant to encompass any cancer, neoplastic and preneoplastic disease that is characterized by abnormal growth of cells. A tumor can be cancerous or benign. A benign tumor means the tumor can grow but does not spread. A cancerous tumor is malignant, meaning it can grow and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Non-limiting examples of cancer include lung cancer, pancreas cancer, myeloma, myeloid leukemia, meningioma, glioblastoma, breast cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, neuroendocrine cancer, colon carcinoma, ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkinâs Disease, non-Hodgkinâs lymphomas, rectum cancer, urinary cancers, uterine cancers, oral cancers, skin cancers, stomach cancer, brain tumors, liver cancer, laryngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, mammary tumors, fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, Ewingâs sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystandeocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilmsâ tumor, cervical cancer, testicular tumor, endometrial cancer, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioblastomas, neuronomas, craniopharingiomas, schwannomas, glioma, astrocytoma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, leukemias and lymphomas, acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic polycythemia vera, multiple myeloma, Waldenstromâs macroglobulinemia, and heavy chain disease, acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, childhood-null acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), thymic ALL, B-cell ALL, acute megakaryocytic leukemia, Burkittâs lymphoma, and T cell leukemia, small and large non-small cell lung carcinoma, acute granulocytic leukemia, germ cell tumors, endometrial cancer, gastric cancer, hairy cell leukemia, thyroid cancer and other cancers known in the art.

[0057] As used herein, the termâsampleâ refers to a biological sample obtained or derived from a subject. In some embodiments, the sample is a complex biological sample without any prior depletion of a biomolecule ( e.g ., protein). In some embodiments, a sample comprises nucleic acids representing all or substantially of the nucleic acid sequences found in a subject. In some embodiments, a sample comprises polypeptides or a set of amino acid sequences representing all or substantially of the polypeptide sequences found in a subject. In some embodiments, a sample comprises biological tissue or fluid. Suitable biological samples include, but are not limited to, blood, blood cells, serums, ascites, tissue or fine needle biopsy samples, cell-containing body fluids, lung lavage, cell lysates, bone marrow, sputum, saliva, urine, amniotic fluid, cerebrospinal fluids, tears, semen, tissue biopsy specimens, surgical specimens, other body fluids, secretions, and/or excretions, and/or cells therefrom.

In some embodiments, the biological fluids are prepared by methods and kits known in the art. For example, some biological samples (e.g. menstrual blood, blood samples, semen, etc.) can first be centrifuged at low speed to remove cell debris, blood clots and other cellular components that can interfere with the array. In other embodiments, for example, tissue specimens can be processed, e.g. , tissue samples can be minced or homogenized, treated with enzymes to break up the tissue and/or centrifuged to remove cellular debris allowing for the assaying and extraction of the biomolecules within the tissue samples. Suitable methods of isolating and/or properly preparing and storing samples are known in the art, and can include, but are not limited, the addition of an anti-coagulant agent. [0058] The termsâcomplex sampleâ orâcomplex biological sampleâ refer to any biological sample comprising a plurality of any suitable organic molecules (e.g, proteins, polynucleotides, lipids, metabolites), inorganic molecules, submicroscopic agents (e.g, phage). Non-limiting exemplary components of a complex sample include nucleic acid molecules (e.g, nucleotides, oligonucleotides, polynucleotides, DNA, RNA DNA aptamers, RNA aptamers), amino acids, peptides, proteins (native or recombinant), peptide aptamers, antibodies, plasmids, phages, microorganisms, cells, antibodies, organelles, cofactors, and metal ions.

[0059] The termâmulti-omic(s)â orâmultiomic(s)â refers to an analytical approach for analyzing biomolecules at a large scale, wherein the data sets are multiple omes, such as proteome, genome, transcriptome, lipidome, and metabolome. Non-limiting exemplary multi- omic data includes proteomic data, genomic data, lipidomic data, glycomic data, transcriptomic data, or metabolomics data. [0060] The termsâindividual,ââsubject,â andâpatientâ are used interchangeably herein irrespective of whether the subject has or is currently undergoing any form of treatment. In some embodiments, the subject is diagnosed with or suspected of having or developing a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the disease is cancer. In some embodiments, the subject is in cancer remission. As used herein, the termâsubjectâ generally refers to any vertebrate, including, but not limited to a mammal. Examples of mammals including primates, including simians and humans, equines ( e.g ., horses), canines ( e.g ., dogs), felines, various domesticated livestock (e.g., ungulates, such as swine, pigs, goats, sheep, and the like), as well as domesticated pets (e.g, cats, hamsters, mice, and guinea pigs). In some embodiments, the subject is a human. Exemplary human patients can be male and/or female.âPatient in need thereofâ orâsubject in need thereofâ is referred to herein as a patient diagnosed with or suspected of having a disease or disorder, for instance, but not restricted to cancer. [0061] âAdministeringâ is referred to herein as providing one or more compositions described herein to a patient or a subject. By way of example and not limitation, composition administration, e.g, injection, can be performed by intravenous (i.v.) injection, sub-cutaneous (s.c.) injection, intradermal (i.d.) injection, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, or intramuscular (i.m.) injection. One or more such routes can be employed. Parenteral administration can be, for example, by bolus injection or by gradual perfusion over time. Alternatively, or concurrently, administration can be by the oral route. Additionally, administration can also be, but not limited to, oral administration, mucosal administration, inhalational administration, ocular administration, transdermal administration, rectal administration, intracystic administration, enteral administration, parenteral administration, surgical deposition of a bolus or pellet of cells, or positioning of a medical device. [0062] The termsâtreat,ââtreated,ââtreating,ââtreatment,â and their grammatical equivalents are meant to refer to reducing or ameliorating a disorder and/or symptoms associated therewith (e.g, a cancer). âTreatingâ can refer to administration of the therapy to a subject after the onset, or suspected onset, of a cancer. âTreatingâ includes the concepts ofâalleviatingâ, which refers to lessening the frequency of occurrence or recurrence, or the severity, of any symptoms or other ill effects related to e.g, a cancer and/or the side effects associated with e.g, cancer therapy. The termâtreatingâ can also encompass the concept ofâmanagingâ which refers to reducing the severity of a particular disease or disorder in a patient or delaying its recurrence, e.g, lengthening the period of remission in a patient who had suffered from the disease. It is appreciated that, although not precluded, treating a disorder or condition does not require that the disorder, condition, or symptoms associated therewith be completely eliminated. In embodiments, the effect is therapeutic, i.e., the effect partially or completely cures a disease and/or adverse symptom attributable to the disease. [0063] The termâtherapeutic effectâ refers to some extent of relief of one or more of the symptoms of a disorder ( e.g ., a neoplasia or tumor) or its associated pathology. [0064] The termâtherapeutically effective amountâ,âtherapeutic amountâ or its grammatical equivalents as used herein refers to an amount of an agent which is effective, upon single or multiple dose administration to the cell or subject, in prolonging the survivability of the patient with such a disorder, reducing one or more signs or symptoms of the disorder, preventing or delaying, and the like beyond that expected in the absence of such treatment.âTherapeutically effective amountâ is intended to qualify the amount required to achieve a therapeutic effect. The therapeutically effective amount can vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and can be determined by a physician with consideration of individual differences in e.g., age, weight, tumor size, extent of infection or metastasis, and condition of the patient (subject). OVERVIEW [0065] In training classifiers against complex biomolecule sampling, the classification model weights are dependent on the dataset and are relative within the dataset. For example, if a feature (e.g. , protein) is removed from a data set, the weights of the other features are recalculated during retraining. The methods disclosed herein provide consistency of important features across many independent datasets by focusing on the subset of the important features consistent across different datasets. The methods provided herein identify the subset currently not related to known knowledge as a novel biomarker. [0066] The present disclosure relates to a method of broad dynamic range sampling of biomolecules in a complex biological sample. In an embodiment, the method relates to a proteome sampling without prior protein depletion. In an embodiment, the method relates to a proteome sampling before prior protein depletion. In an embodiment, the method relates to a proteome sampling after prior protein depletion. In another embodiment, the method of proteome sampling is independent of direct plasma protein concentration, enabling accurate clustering algorithms to generate protein biomarkers. In an embodiment, the method relates to analyzing multiple samplings such that a relational database, a Corona Knowledge Map (CKM), is produced which can be used to rationally design particles, such as a corona, based on the surface-activity relationship of biomarkers to the particle, such as a corona, that captured them. [0067] There are several public searchable metabolome database and proteome database known in the art. The present methods of the disclosure can be used with such public databases. Examples of public databases include but are not limited to Open Targets (opentargets.org), Gene Ontology Consortium (geneontology.org), Plasma Proteome Database (plasmaproteomedatabase.org), METLIN (metlin.scripps.edu), Human Metabolome Database (hmdb.ca), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (genome.jp/kegg/), Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/), Proteomics Identifications (PRIDE) (ebi.ac.uk/pride), ProteomicsDB (proteomicsdb.org), or Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (bmrb.wisc.edu/metabolomics/). This existing public knowledge base can be leveraged individually or by using aggregators such as Open Targets, Gene Ontology Consortium, and similar commercial offerings. In addition to public knowledge bases, the methods herein can also be used with proprietary databases. For example, the Corona Knowledge Map (CKM) is a relational database to rationally design particles based on the analysis of surface-activity relationships (e.g., referencing data from a protein structure database and/or a protein-ligand co- crystal structure database) between the biomarkers captured and the particle which captured them. [0068] Provided herein is a new approach to broadly sample the proteome without, before and after protein depletion and/or independent of direct plasma protein concentration. The present disclosure can identify proteins that are linked to a specified biological state (e.g., a disease) but which are present in very low or non-recorded concentrations in the plasma, serum, whole blood, amniotic fluid, cerebral spinal fluid, urine, saliva, tears, feces according to the Plasma Proteome Database and other databases. Non-limiting examples of a specified biological state is a disease state, a poor clinical outcome, a good clinical outcome, a high risk of disease, a low risk of disease, a complete response to a treatment, a partial response to a treatment, a stable disease state, or a non-response to a treatment. Non-limiting exemplary proteins labeled with disease is provided in Table 1. [0069] âBiological stateâ encompasses any biological characteristic of a subject which can be manifested in a biological sample as defined herein. A biological state can be detected using the methods disclosed herein where two subjects who differ in the biological state manifest those differences in the composition of a sample. For example, a biological state includes a disease state of a subject. A disease state can be detected when the disease state gives rise to changes in the molecular composition (e.g., level of one or more proteins) of a sample of a subject expressing the disease state relative to a sample of a subject not having the disease state (e.g., where the biological state is a healthy state or non-disease state). [0070] Another example of a biological state is a level of responsiveness of a subject to a particular therapeutic treatment (e.g. administration of one or a combination of drugs or pharmaceuticals). In some embodiments, a biological state is responsiveness (e.g., with respect to a particular threshold of analysis) of a subject to a particular drug. In another embodiment, a biological state is non-responsiveness (e.g., with respect to a particular threshold of analysis) of a subject to a particular drug. In some embodiments, the level of responsiveness of a subject to a drug (i.e., biological state of responsiveness to the drug or biological state of non-responsiveness to the drug) is associated with factors such as variability in metabolism or pharmacokinetics of the drug between subjects. [0071] Another example of a biological state is the level of immune response exhibited by a subject. In some embodiments, the biological state can be increased immune response. In other embodiments, the biological state can be decreased immune response. Immune response can differ between subjects as a result of a number of variables. For example, immune response can differ between subjects as a result of differing exposure to an exogenously introduced antigen (e.g. associated with a virus or bacteria), as a result of differences in their susceptibility to an autoimmune disease or disorder, or secondarily as a result of a response to other biological states in a subject (e.g., disease states such as cancer). [0072] The term 'disease state' for a subject as used herein refers to the ability of sensor array of the present technology to be able to differentiate between the different states of a disease within a subject. This term encompasses a predisease state or precursor state of a disease or disorder (a state in which the subject may not have any outward signs or symptoms of the disease or disorder but will develop the disease or disorder in the future) and a disease state in which the subject has a stage of the disease or disorder (e.g., an early, intermediate or late stage of the disease or disorder). In other words, the disease state is a spectrum that encompasses a continuum regarding the health of a subject with respect to a disease or disorder. [0073] The disease state also includes a precursor state of a disease or disorder. This precursor state is a state in which the subject does not have any outward signs or symptoms of the disease or disorder (although there may be submacro changes within the biomolecules of the subject found in their blood or other biological fluids) but will develop the disease or disorder in the future. [0074] In some embodiments, the methods of the present technology include comparing the protein fingerprint of the sample to a panel of protein fingerprints associated with a plurality of diseases and/or a plurality of disease states to determine if the sample indicates a disease and/or disease state. For example, samples can be collected from a population of subjects over time. Once the subjects develop a disease or disorder, the present invention allows for the ability to characterize and detect the changes in biomolecule fingerprints over time in the subject by comparing the biomolecule fingerprint of the sample from the same subject before they have developed a disease to the biomolecule fingerprint of the subject after they have developed the disease. In some embodiments, samples can be taken from cohorts of patients who all develop the same disease, allowing for analysis and characterization of the biomolecule fingerprints that are associated with the different stages of the disease for these patients (e.g. from pre-disease to disease states). [0075] Methods of determining a biomolecule fingerprint associated with at least one disease or disorder and/or a disease state are contemplated. The methods comprise the steps of obtaining a sample from at least two subjects diagnosed with the at least one disease or disorder or having the same disease state; contacting each sample with a sensor array described herein to determining a biomolecule fingerprint for each sensor array, and analyzing the fingerprint of the at least two samples to determine a biomolecule fingerprint associated with the at least one disease or disorder and/or disease state. [0076] Provided herein is a computer-implemented method for detecting one or more biomarkers in a multi-omic data set (e.g., proteomic data set). In some embodiments, the computer-implemented method comprises (1) providing a multi-omic data (e.g, proteomic data) generated from one or more complex biological samples obtained from one or more individuals, each individual having one or more specified biological states; (2) applying a trained model to the multi-omic data (e.g, proteome data) to generate one or more classification model weights, wi . . . wn, for one or more features, f . . . fn, yielding (wi,fi), . . . ,(wn,fn) and storing (wi,fi), . . . ,(wn,fn); (3) querying a reference data set for the one or more features, fi . . . fn, to generate a set of scores, Si . . . sn, yielding (si,fi), . . . ,(sn,fn) and storing (si,fi), . . . ,(sn,fn); and (4) combining at least (wi,f), Â· Â· Â· ,(wn,fn) and (si,fi), . . . , (sn,fn) to generate (wi,S ), Â· Â· Â· ,(wn, sn) and selecting a subset of (wi,Si), . . . ,(wn, sn) to detect one or more biomarkers. [0077] In some embodiments, the method further comprises obtaining one or more complex biological samples from one or more individuals. In some embodiments, the multi-omic data is proteomic data, genomic data, lipidomic data, glycomic data, transcriptomic data, or metabolomics data. In some embodiments, the one or more complex biological samples are plasma proteome samples. In some cases, the proteome data comprises (i) protein identifiers and (ii) specified biological states for the one or more individuals. The proteome data can be generated by assaying a complex biological sample of an individual of the one or more individuals as describe herein.

In some cases, the one or more complex biological samples are not subjected to protein depletion. In one embodiment, the surface-activity relationships between biological sample biomarker and capture particle, such as a corona, are catalogued into a relational database known as a Corona Knowledge Map (CKM). The CKM can be used to rationally design particles to target potential biomarkers. COMPLEX BIOMOLECULE SAMPLING [0078] The present disclosure relates to generating potential biomarkers present in a low or non-recorded concentration in samples by applying machine learning clustering algorithms to a large disease labeled training set of complex biomolecule data or proteome data ( e.g ., plasma protein levels) and comparing the classification weights to existing knowledge bases. Techniques to produce broad range sampling of complex biomolecules (e.g., plasma proteome) without a prior depletion and independent of e.g, plasma protein concentration and to generate a large training and test data set of disease labeled biomolecule (e.g, protein) levels across many patient sample are described in International Patent Application PCT/US2017/067013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0079] In some embodiments, classification model weight and importance for each protein in each disease label, the definition depends on the algorithm used. The classification model weight of Table 1 is generated using Random Forest. Random Forest allows estimation of the classification model weight and importance for each protein by a number of methods, one being removing or perturbing the values. The average of the resulting changes in classification error provides an indication of weight. The classification model weights are dependent on the dataset and are relative within the dataset. For example, if a feature (protein) is removed from a data set, the weights of the other features are recalculated when the model is retrained. For example, if the same algorithm is used on a similar but a new set of data, the weight can be different. The methods disclosed herein provide consistency of important features across many independent datasets by focusing on the subset of the important features consistent across different datasets. The methods provided herein identify the subset currently not related to known knowledge as a novel biomarker. [0080] Machine learning classification algorithms such as Partial Least Squares, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest can be applied to the disease labeled biomolecules to build a trained classification model with both a high sensitivity and specificity. The features of individual biomolecules are extracted by inspecting the trained classification model and their associated classification weights and store as a set of data. Another data set is created by querying data aggregators such as Open Targets, Gene Ontology Consortium and commercial options for all known biomolecules ( e.g ., proteins or expressing genes) connected with the labeled diseases and their respective association score. The classification strength of the biomolecule (e.g., protein) to its strength of associations in public and private databases to the labeled diseases is compared for the set of potential biomarkers. Exemplary analysis of the trained classification model of protein proteome is shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3. The lower right quadrant of FIG. 2 represents proteins that have a significant weight in the classification but with little existing knowledge associating the proteins to the specified disease. Therefore, these proteins are suitable candidates for novel biomarkers. The upper left quadrant of FIG. 2 represents proteins that have a large body of evidence linking them to the disease but weak classification weights. These proteins could represent either a common mechanism or set of mechanisms for multiple diseases which the classification weights cannot differentiate, or alternatively, could represent a weak role in the classification of the disease. These exemplary proteins referred to in FIG. 2 are shown in Table 2. [0081] The upper right and lower left quadrants help support the validity of the classification model. FIG. 3 is a bar graph of classification model weight, represents all 850+ proteins detected in the broad range proteome sampling, ordered in descending classification model weight. The top plot represents the top 50 proteins (Table 2), and the bottom plot shows all 850+ proteins. The existing knowledge for association to disease is high if that protein is well associated to the disease through existing knowledge. Proteins with low existing knowledge for association to disease represent suitable candidates for potential biomarkers as they represent proteins with a significant classification weight but little existing knowledge. FIG. 4 is an image of a user interface of a knowledge map wherein information on the surface-activity relationship between captured proteins and the particle which captured them is catalogued such that particles can be rationally designed to target potential biomarker candidates. [0082] The methods of the present disclosure can be used with a complex biological sample. Biomolecules can refer to any molecule or biological component that can be produced by, present in, a biological organism. Non-limiting examples of biomolecules include proteins, polypeptides, polysaccharides, a sugar, a lipid, a lipoprotein, a metabolite, an oligonucleotide, a nucleic acid (DNA, RNA, microRNA, plasmid, single stranded nucleic acid, and double stranded nucleic acid), metabolome, as well as small molecules such as primary metabolites, secondary metabolites, and other natural products, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the biomolecule is selected from the group of proteins ( e.g ., polypeptides or peptides), nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolomes. [0083] In some embodiments, the protein is a mature protein. In some embodiments, the mature protein can include glycosylation or other modification (e.g., post-translational modification). Non-limiting examples of post-translational modifications include phosphorylation, acylation including acetylation and formylation, glycosylation (including N- linked and O-linked), amidation, hydroxyl ati on, alkylation including methylation and ethylation, ubiquitylation, addition of pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, formation of disulfide bridges, sulfation, myristoylation, palmitoylation, isoprenyl ati on, farnesylation, geranylation, glypiation, lipoylation and iodination. Polypeptides can comprise D-amino acids, L-amino acids, and non natural amino acids, or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the proteins can be a monomer, a homodimer, or a heteromultimer of polypeptides. [0084] In some embodiments, the lipids include a variety of insoluble biomolecules, such as neutral fats, oils, and steroids. Lipids include simple lipids, triglycerides, eicosanoids, complex lipids, phospholipids, steroids, cholesterol, and lipid-related molecules. Simple lipids contain only two types of components, i.e., fatty acids and alcohols. Non-limiting examples of simple lipids include triglycerides, triacylglycerol, diglycerides, and monoglycerides. Fatty acids are long chains of carbon and hydrogen each with a carboxyl acid functional group (-COOH) at one end. The chain length varies but most fatty acids possess even number of carbon atoms with sixteen or eighteen carbon fatty acids as the most common. Fatty acids can be saturated, unsaturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated. Triacylglycerols or triglycerides form when glycerol links to three fatty acids, of which can be different chain lengths. Eicosanoids are modified fatty acids or lipid-related molecules produced by slight alterations in the fatty acid chain of arachidonic acid. Non-limiting examples of eicosanoids can include prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and lipoxins. Complex lipids can comprise fatty acids, glycerol, and an alcohol besides glycerol, a carbohydrate and a phosphate group. Non-limiting examples of complex lipids include phospholipids and steroids. Phospholipids are phosphate containing lipid molecules. Steroids are a class of lipid-related molecules derived from cholesterol. Non limiting examples of steroids include cholesterol, testosterone, estrogen and cortisol. [0085] In some embodiments, nucleic acids comprise to a polymeric form of nucleotides or nucleic acids of any length, either ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides. This term refers only to the primary structure of the molecule. Thus, this term includes double and single stranded DNA, triplex DNA, as well as double and single stranded RNA. It also includes modified, for example, by methylation and/or by capping, and unmodified forms of the polynucleotide. When a polynucleotide such as an oligonucleotide is represented by a sequence of letters, it is understood that the nucleotides are in 5â 3â order from left to right and that 'A' denotes deoxyadenosine, 'C' denotes deoxycytidine, 'G' denotes deoxyguanosine, and 'T' denotes thymidine, unless otherwise noted. The letters A, C, G, and T can be used to refer to the bases themselves, to nucleosides, or to nucleotides comprising the bases, as is standard in the art. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a chain of nucleotides comprising 4 types of nucleotides; A (adenine), T (thymine), C (cytosine), and G (guanine), and that RNA (ribonucleic acid) comprising 4 types of nucleotides; A, U (uracil), G, and C. DNA and RNA can also comprise synthetic nucleotides or chemically modified nucleotides. Certain pairs of nucleotides specifically bind to one another in a complementary fashion (called complementary base pairing). That is, adenine (A) can pair with thymine (T) (in the case of RNA, however, adenine (A) can pair with uracil (U)), and cytosine (C) can pair with guanine (G). When a first nucleic acid strand binds to a second nucleic acid strand made up of nucleotides that are complementary to those in the first strand, the two strands bind to form a double strand. [0086] Biomarkers identified with the methods provided herein can be biomolecules that can be evaluated in a sample and are associated with a specified biological state. The specified biological state can mean, but not limited to, a disease state, a poor clinical outcome, a good clinical outcome, a high risk of disease, a low risk of disease, a complete response to a treatment, a partial response to a treatment, a stable disease state, or a non-response to a treatment. In some embodiments, a disease state refers to cancer prognosis, cancer diagnosis, cancer treatment response, cancer treatment option, post-cancer management, or any combination thereof. [0087] In some embodiments, biomarkers are the molecules that can be evaluated in a sample and are associated with a specified biological state. For example, markers include genes, expressed genes or their products ( e.g ., proteins) or autoantibodies to those proteins that can be detected from human samples, such as blood, serum, solid tissue, and the like, that is associated with a specified biological state.

Proteomic Samplings [0110] Proteins are essential cellular machinery, performing and enabling tasks within biological systems. The variety of proteins is extensive, and the role they occupy in biology is deep and complex; life depends on proteins. Each step of cellular generation, from replication of genetic material to cell senescence and death, relies on the correct function of several distinct proteins. The precision of cellular machinery can be disrupted, however, resulting in disease. Because much of the machinery essential to cell health and survival remains unknown, studying proteins is of great interest and importance. The field of proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins and the proteome and encompasses many techniques, such as, but not limited to, immunoassays and two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE), and mass spectrometry. In some embodiments, mass spectrometry-based proteomics comprises top-down analysis. In some embodiments, mass spectrometry-based proteomics comprises bottom-up analysis. Top-down methods analyze whole proteins; bottom-up approaches investigate the peptides from digested proteins. There are unique methods of analysis that each group has developed, but they share in common their mode of analysis. In mass spectrometric analysis, the mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of molecular species are determined. By collecting this data, compounds in the sample can be identified by comparing against standard databases of compounds and molecules with known masses. From whole protein analysis in top-down proteomics, to peptide analysis in bottom-up proteomics, each particle measured has an m/z signature detectable by the mass spectrometer. By pairing mass analyzers and detectors, adding equipment in different configurations, and coupling separations and mass spectrometers together, there are virtually limitless possibilities, functionalities, and speeds of data acquisition for mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has advanced rapidly since the advent ofâsoftâ ionization techniques, such as electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI). Methods of detection previously used for organic chemicals and other sample identifications were adapted for proteomics. Several combinations of ionization sources and mass analyzers are available commercially, each with merits for specific applications. Time-of-flight (TOF) instruments are often coupled with MALDI instruments. ESI-TOF instruments can provide high-speed, continuous measurements without compromising resolution. High-resolution Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometers are costly, but provide unsurpassed data collection power using both electrospray and MALDI ion sources. In some cases, The Orbitrap mass analyzer provides a high mass resolution instrument at a lower cost than Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FT-ICR). With mass spectrometric analysis, such as the Orbitrap, combined with the selectivity of ion traps and quadrupoles with analysis of complex samples with high mass accuracy and specificity, even in small quantities, can be completed with increasing ease and confidence. [0111] A mass spectrometer is an instrument that measures the masses of individual molecules that have been converted into ions, i.e., molecules that have been electrically charged. A mass spectrometer measures the mass-to-charge (âm/zâ) ratio of the ions formed from the molecules. The sample, which can be a solid, liquid, or vapor, enters a vacuum chamber through an inlet. Depending on the type of inlet and ionization techniques used, the sample can already exist as ions in solution, or it can be ionized in conjunction with its volatilization or by other methods in the ion source. The gas phase ions are sorted in the mass analyzer according to their m/z ratios and then collected by a detector. In the detector, the ion flux is converted to a proportional electrical current. A data system records the magnitude of these electrical signals as a function of m/z and converts this information into a mass spectrum. Further information on mass spectrometers and their use is described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,504,150 and 6,960,760, each of which is incorporated herein by its entirety. [0112] The complex sample or complex biological sample as described herein can contain at least one type of a biomolecule within the complex sample. In some embodiments, the at least one type of a biomolecule comprises a biomarker of interest. In some embodiment, the biomarker of interest is not present in the sample. In some embodiments, the biomarker of interest is highly prevalent and has saturated the dynamic range of the test. In some embodiments, the biomarker of interest is present at an intermediate concentration. [0113] In some embodiments, the fraction of a sample comprising a particular biomolecule at which binding occurs is mapped to the concentration of the binding biomarker in the sample. Typically, a correlation is made between the number of biomarkers of a given biomolecule type. By determining the number of bound biomolecules, a determination and/or estimate of the number and/or quantity of the specific biomarker ( e.g ., protein) present in the original sample can be made. However, this is not strictly necessary for a chemistry signature of the sample to be useful. Rather, the process can be repeatable and dispersive. That is, a range of species concentrations in the sample can produce a range of fractions of bound biomolecules, rather than collapsing onto a single fraction of bound biomolecules. [0114] The ability of the biomarkers of a particular biomolecule type to saturate is an important aspect of the present disclosure, as it limits the level of influence that any one species, particularly a high abundance species, can have in the determined signature. The mass spectroscopy signal can be 'clipped', greatly improving the signal to noise ratio problem described earlier. By limiting the influence (i.e., clipping its signal) of one or more species that would otherwise be abundant in the sample, the mass spectrometer can more effectively detect variations of low abundance species as their signals are not overshadowed by high abundance species. Examples of high abundance proteins include, but are not limited to albumin, immunoglobulin, transferrin, factor H, C9 complement, C8 complement, C5 complement, C6 complement, C7 complement, fibrinogen; examples of low abundance protein include but are not limited to cytokines, signaling molecules, intracellular proteins, interleukin-4, TNF alpha, interferon gamma, interleukin-l Beta, interleukin- 12, interleukin-5, interleukin- 10, and interleukin-6 (N. Leigh Anderson and Norman G. Anderson, The Human Plasma Proteome: History, Character, and Diagnostic Prospects, MOLECULAR & CELLULAR PROTEOMICS 1 : 845-867, 2002.). It should be understood that this is not an exhaustive list of high abundance proteins and low abundance proteins. One of skill in the art can recognize additional high abundance proteins and additional low abundance proteins that are in the biological sample. This is especially the case for low abundance proteins as there are a vast variety of low abundance proteins. The proteins (high abundance and low abundance) can be selected out of the sample and the signal of the high abundance proteins and low abundance proteins can be clipped or enhanced, respectively. [0115] The proteomic sampling methods provided herein contemplate uses of various mass spectrometry methods to analyze proteins. Some methods are discovery-based, where samples are analyzed to determine what proteins are present in the sample. Often a high-resolution mass spectrometer is used for this purpose, as the false-discovery rate of protein identifications from peptides rely on highly accurate mass-to-charge measurements. Some methods are targeted, focusing on single proteins of interest and quantifying them in different samples or sample fractions. Highly selective methods using ion traps and quadrupoles are ideal for targeted analysis. Proteins and peptides can be fragmented in the mass spectrometer for tandem mass spectrometry in a variety of ways, and those fragments are analyzed for de novo peptide sequencing or peptide mass fingerprinting. The vast majority of peptide identifications are accomplished with fragmentation followed by protein database searches of the resulting fragments. Electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron transfer dissociation (ETD), higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD), collision-induced dissociation (CID), and a host of other fragmentation methods are available, each with recommended applications. Furthermore, mass spectrometry methods are often customized within software. [0116] The mass spectrometer is a critical aspect in proteomic experiments; however, the results obtained from the mass spectrometer are limited by the sample. Regardless of the analysis approach used, a high quality sample is critical for a successful experiment. Proteomic analyses depend on the sample containing proteins to analyze. Sample preparation approaches that are time-consuming, or worse, incur massive sample losses, are intolerable. Techniques to produce proteomic sampling of e.g ., plasma proteome without a prior depletion and independent of e.g. , plasma protein concentration and to generate a large training and test data set of disease labeled biomarker protein levels across many patient sample are described in International Patent Application PCT/US2017/067013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Also contemplated herein are various other proteomic sampling preparation methods, such as affinity purification, size exclusion, hydrophobic exclusion, charge exclusion. Also contemplated herein is the creation of a relational database in which the surface-activity relationships between biomarkers and capture particles such as coronas are analyzed in order to rationally design capture particles. In order to obtain protein from a complex biological sample, the sample must first be harvested from the organism, culture, or patient. Samples can be obtained by several methods. Traditional dissection from animal species, biopsies, blood draws, and additional methods can deliver adequate protein for analysis. The proteins in the sample must be made readily accessible via lysis and extraction from the cells in the sample. [0117] Numerous methods for lysis and extraction are well known in the art, e.g. , lysis buffers, mechanical disruption strategies, a chemical lysis and extraction agent, along with some mechanical stimulus that physically breaks apart the cell, allowing the chemical agent to solubilize the available protein. Non-limiting exemplary common detergents for mass spectrometry and cell lysis include Triton X-100, NP-40, Tween 20, Tween 80, octyl glucoside, octyl thioglucoside, Big CHAP, deoxycholate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, CHAPS, and CHAPSO. Lysis buffers can differ in critical micelle concentration (CMC). The CMC is the concentration at which the detergent forms micelles spontaneously, which can affect their efficacy and removal in different environments. Above this point, the detergent forms micelles, and detergent added can move directly into micelles. Higher CMC values are associated with weaker hydrophobic binding to monomers. Thus, higher CMC detergents tend to be more easily removed by buffer exchange and dialysis. Solutions with lower CMC values form micelles more easily, and generally require less detergent to effectively solubilize protein. Another factor that can affect a lysis buffer is the micelle molecular weight (MMW). Lower-weight micelles are more easily removed than higher-weight micelles. Making use of CMC and MMW to determine the best course of the experiment is well known in the art. Choosing a lysis buffer depends greatly on these detergent factors. Most of the detergents listed are incompatible with downstream mass spectrometry analysis, and must be removed. Lysis, extraction, and denaturation of protein can occur in the same step with certain procedures, such as with sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS while boiling and agitating the sample.

[0118] Once protein is extracted, removal of contaminants and detergents is necessary. Some detergents can interfere with enzymatic digestion. Some detergents can interfere with reverse- phase separations and mass spectrometry. Removal of unwanted cellular material, such as lipids and genomic DNA, prevents signal suppression, chromatographic interference, and presents a much cleaner, clearer spectrum from which to obtain protein identification data. Various methods of contaminant removal are well known in the art. Non-limiting exemplary methods of contaminant removal include precipitation, salting out, ultrafiltration, polyethyleneimine (PEI), isoelectric point (PI), thermal, and nonionic polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG).

In-solution digestion involves denaturing, reducing, alkylating, and digesting the protein sample in the liquid phase, as opposed to in a gel or on a filter. In solution digestion is well known in the art. See De Godoy, L.M.F. et al. Comprehensive mass- spectrometry-based proteome quantification of haploid versus diploid yeast.

In-solution digestion can be performed using single-tube approaches, eliminating much of the sample loss that occurs during solution transfer between different vessels. Generally in-solution digests are fractionated after digestion, but fractionation can be performed previous to digestion using different forms of chromatography, including, but not limited to, strong and weak ion exchange, reverse-phase, and size exclusion chromatography. [0120] Gel-based mass spectrometry analysis is well known in the art and widely used as a first method of separation prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. See Lasonder, E. el al.

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the light of new developments. TrAC Trends Anal. Chem. 2014, 53, 167-177; Shevchenko, A. et al. Mass spectrometric sequencing of proteins from silver-stained polyacrylamide gels. Anal. Chem. 1996, 68, 850-858. Different methods of gel electrophoresis are well known in the art. Before the digestion, separation of the protein is performed using a gel. In one of the most common proteomic sample preparation strategies, a denaturing gel (sodium dodecyl sulfate in a polyacrylamide gel, SDS-PAGE) is used for bottom-up proteomics, as the protein can be cleaved into peptides in later steps. The gel is used to separate whole protein in one or two dimensions. After destaining, the proteins are excised from the gel and subjected to enzymatic proteolysis. Peptides can then be analyzed via mass spectrometry. The stained gel pieces are then excised from the gel, destained, and the protein within the gel piece is subjected to digestion. Strategies for in-gel digestions are well known in the art. [0121] Various mass spectrometry and fractionation combinations for delving deeply into the proteome of organisms and model systems are well known in the art. For example, for the yeast proteome, the multi-dimensional protein identification technology is used for the yeast proteome. Accurate mass tags (AMT) were developed in order to decrease the need for tandem mass spectrometry while providing more sensitive measurements and greater dynamic range. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a very common separation technique with a wide variety of stationary phases. With the advent of ultra-performance liquid chromatography (EIPLC), chromatographic separations have increased both in resolving power and speed of separation. HPLC and ETPLC function on the same principles. EIPLC columns generally offer smaller particle sizes, resulting in decreased analyte path length and higher column pressures (10,000 pounds per square inch (PSI) or greater in maximum). Liquid Chromatography is often coupled with electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometers for both top-down and bottom-up proteomic analysis. LC has been used for a staggering number of analyses; LC-MS is a commonly used for proteomic analysis. Liquid chromatography is robust, customizable based on the functionality of the stationary particles in the separation column. For bottom-up proteomic analysis, the most common HPLC/UPLC stationary phase is the Cl 8 reverse-phase column. The reverse-phase column uses the hydrophobicity of peptides for separation, utilizing a gradient from low to high organic-phase solvent. Acidified methanol and acetonitrile are commonly used as organic-phase, also known asâBâ orâstrongâ solvents because of their miscibility with aqueous solutions. Acidified water is most often theâweakâ solvent, also known asâAâ. Both buffers are acidified with the same acid, generally with formic acid or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) at 0.1% or 0.01%, respectively. Formic acid is preferred over TFA, as TFA tends to form adducts and suppress signal. While reverse-phase columns are commonly used, many stationary phases are in use for proteomic work in both one- and two-dimensional separations, online and off-line. A separation strategy known as electrostatic repulsion hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ERLIC) has gained popularity for phosphoproteomic work, using adjustments in pH and volatile salts for gradient separations. As the name suggests, ERLIC uses the charge and hydrophilicity of peptides as a basis for separation. Typically ERLIC begins with a low-organic, high-pH gradient, moving to high organic and low-pH as the separation moves on. In this way, ERLIC elutes peptides in order of increasing hydrophobicity and acidity. ERLIC has proven effective at separating and identifying modified and unmodified proteins. Smaller-diameter columns with lower loading capacities and smaller stationary phase particles offer an advantage in microproteomics. By increasing the local concentration of peptide and decreasing eddy diffusion, sample loading amounts can be minimized and still provide adequate peptide signal; the chromatographic resolution necessary for complex sample separation is not compromised.

Application of Complex Biomolecule Samplings [0122] The present disclosure relates to machine learning algorithms for a complex biomolecule sampling ( e.g ., proteome sampling) from a subject. The algorithms provided herein can aid in selection of previously unknown biomarkers and provide a report comprising a score or probability relating to, for example, disease risk, disease likelihood, presence or absence of disease, treatment response, and/or classification of disease status. [0123] Methods of diagnosing or prognosing a disease or disorder using the biomarkers identified by the present methods are also contemplated. The methods comprise obtaining a sample from a subject; contacting the sample with e.g ., a plurality of nanoparticles to produce a complex biomolecule sampling data, and comparing the complex biomolecule sampling data to the known cohort of biomolecule data identified in the disease or disorder; and diagnosing or prognosing the disease or disorder based on the presence of one of more of the identified biomarkers. [0124] In some embodiments, methods of identifying patterns of biomarkers or specific biomarkers associated with a disease or disorder are contemplated. Suitable methods, include, for example, preforming the methods described above (e.g. obtaining a samples from at least two subjects diagnosed with the disease or disorder and at least two control subjects; contacting each sample with the sensor array to produce a biomolecule fingerprint, and comparing the biomolecule fingerprint of the subjects with the disease or disorder to the biomolecule fingerprint of the control subjects to determine at least one pattern and/or biomarker associated with the disease or disorder. Suitable, the method can comprise at least 2 disease subjects and at least two control subjects, alternatively at least 5 disease subjects and at least 5 control subjects, alternatively at least 10 disease subjects and at least 10 control subjects, alternatively at least 15 disease subjects and at least 15 control subjects, alternatively at least 20 disease subjects and at least 20 control subjects, and includes any variations in between (e.g. disease subjects from at least 2-100, and control subjects from at least 2-100). [0125] In some embodiments, the arrays and methods allow for the determination of a pattern of biomarkers associated with the disease state or disease or disorder or, in some embodiments, specific biomarkers that are associated with the disease or disorder. Not only will biomarkers that can be associated with a disease state be able to be identified, for example, biomarkers listed herein, but new biomarkers or patterns of biomarkers that can be associated with a disease state or a disease or disorder can be determined. As discussed above, some biomarkers or patterns of biomarkers for a specific disease or disorder can be a change in a biomolecule associated with the sensor array of the present disclosure and differ from what is usually referred to as biomarkers in the art, e.g. , and increase expression of a specific biomolecule associated with a disease. As discussed above, it can be the interaction of a biomolecule, e.g. biomolecule X, with other biomolecules, e.g. biomolecule Y and Z, that results in the ability to associate with a specific disease state and cannot correlate with any change in the absolute concentration of biomarker X in the sample over time or disease state. Thus, a molecule that would not in the conventional sense be considered a biomarker since it does not change in absolute concentration in a sample from the pre-disease to disease state, can in view of the present disclosure be considered a biomolecule as its relative changes that are measured by the array of the present disclosure are associated with a disease state. In other words, it can be an increase or decrease in the interaction of biomolecule X (due to the interactions of X with the sensor elements and other biomolecules in the sample) with the array that provides a signal that a biomarker is associated with a disease state. [0126] Any of the methods, kits, and systems described herein can utilize a diagnostic assay for predicting a disease status of a subject or likelihood of a subjectâs response to a therapeutic. The diagnostic assay can use the presence of one or more biomarkers identified using the methods described herein to calculate a quantitative score that can be used to predict disease status or likelihood of response to a therapeutic in a subject. The diagnostic assay can use the presence of one or more biomarkers and one or more characteristics, such as, e.g ., age, weight, gender, medical history, risk factors, family history to calculate a quantitative score that can be used to predict disease status or likelihood of response to a therapeutic in a subject. [0127] In some applications, an increase in a score in the diagnostic assay indicates an increased likelihood of one or more of: a poor clinical outcome, good clinical outcome, high risk of disease, low risk of disease, complete response, partial response, stable disease, non-response, and recommended treatments for disease management. In some embodiments, a decrease in the quantitative score indicates an increased likelihood of one or more of: a poor clinical outcome, good clinical outcome, high risk of disease, low risk of disease, complete response, partial response, stable disease, non-response, and recommended treatments for disease management. [0128] In some applications, a decrease in a score in the diagnostic assay indicates an increased likelihood of one or more of: a poor clinical outcome, good clinical outcome, high risk of disease, low risk of disease, complete response, partial response, stable disease, non-response, and recommended treatments for disease management. In some embodiments, a decrease in the quantitative score indicates an increased likelihood of one or more of: a poor clinical outcome, good clinical outcome, high risk of disease, low risk of disease, complete response, partial response, stable disease, non-response, and recommended treatments for disease management. [0129] Also provided herein are methods for generalized-treatment recommendations for a subject based on their complex biomolecule samplings and methods for subject-speific treatment recommendation. Methods for treatments can comprise following steps: detecting a presence or absence of one or more biomarkers specific for a disease state, such as cancer; recommending to the subject at least one generalized or subject-speific treatment to ameliorate disease symptoms; and monitoring of the disease progression, treatment responses, and recurrence of the disease by detecting the one or more biomarkers. [0130] Methods provided herein can be applied to, for example, tumor (cancer) analysis. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and the growth and developmental mechanisms of tumors are poorly understood. Tumors have substantial cellular heterogeneity, making tumor biology a critical area of study. Methods disclosed herein provide valuable tools to explore the complex proteomic differences within e.g ., a single tumor. Tumor biology and biomarker discovery are major driving forces for proteomic analysis, based on the number of publications on proteomic cancer analysis in recent years. Proteomics is useful for tumor biology due to the breadth of protein information obtainable. Often, diagnosis and evaluation of tumors are done with histology and immunohistochemical analysis. Biopsies are sliced, stained, and analyzed with microscopy. While accurate, precise, and mature, the throughput of this technique is relatively low. Immunostaining and histochemical staining are commonly used for cancer diagnosis, but they are limited techniques. Only one or two proteins can be visualized with traditional microscopy techniques. Tumors can also be biopsied using needle core or aspiration biopsies. The typical diameter of a needle core biopsy is about 1 mm across and about the length of a grain of rice, limiting sample amount and thus the breadth of analyses that can be possible. The methods provided herein can bridge this gap. Diagnosis, proteome analysis, and network analysis can be consolidated, and the methods provided herein can help ensure maximum data from minimal material. Thousands of protein groups can be identified in a single mass spectrometry run. In some embodiments, no prior protein depletion is required. That information is then uploaded into network analysis databases, providing an in- depth look at a tumorâs molecular equilibria. The methods provided herein can identify targets for cancer therapy. Analysis of pathways in cancer can not only give insight into the workings of cancer; it can also give more immediate treatment options, possibly ruling out ineffective therapies or encouraging more productive, less deleterious chemotherapies.

Biomarkers may also be associated with a neurological disease. Suitable biomarkers are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, e.g., A131-42, t-tau and p-tau 181, a-synuclein, among others. See, e.g., Chintamaneni and Bhaskar'Biomarkers in Alzheimer's Disease: A Review' ISRN Pharmacol. 2012. 2012: 984786. Published online 2012 Jun 28, incorporated by reference in its entirety. Biomarkers for inflammatory diseases are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, e.g., cytokines/chemokines, immune-related effectors, acute-phase proteins [C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA)], reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase (COX)- related factors, and mediators such as transcription factors and growth factors , which can include, for example, C-reactive protein (CRP), 5100, LIF, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL4, CXCL5, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL23, IL-I13, IL-IRa, TNF, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, IL- 17F, IL-21, IL-22, IFNy, CXCR1, CXCR4, CXCR5, GM-CSF, GM-CSFR, G-CSF, G-CSFR, EGF, VEGFA, LEP, SAA1, VCAM1, CRP, MMP1, MMP3, TNFRSF1A, RETN, CHI3L1, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), antibodies against cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)] and for chronic IBD (fecal calprotectin), among others.

See, e.g., Yi Fengming and Wu Jianbing, 'Biomarkers of Inflammatory Bowel Disease,' Disease Markers, vol. 2014, Article ID 710915, 11 pages, 2014. doi : 10.1155/2014/710915, incorporated by reference in its entirety. Table 1. Exemplary genes encoding disease labeled proteins [0133] Table 1 provides non-limiting exemplary genes encoding disease labeled proteins. Classification model (Random Forest) weights of each protein and their scores against Open Targets at multiple points in the EFO Ontology are provided. FIG. 2 shows a plot of the trained classification model of cancer vs. disease labeled proteins in Table 1. The lower right quadrant represents proteins that have a significant weight in the classification but with little existing knowledge associating the proteins to the specified disease. Therefore, these proteins are suitable candidates for novel biomarkers. The upper left quadrant represents proteins that have a large body of evidence linking them to the disease but weak classification weights. These proteins could represent either a common mechanism or set of mechanisms for multiple diseases which the classification weights cannot differentiate, or alternatively, could represent a weak role in the classification of the disease. The upper right and lower left quadrants help support the validity of the classification model. FIG. 3 is a bar graph of classification model weight, represents all proteins in Table 1 detected in the broad range proteome sampling, ordered in descending classification model weight. The top plot represents the top 50 proteins (by classification model weight), and the bottom plot shows all proteins in Table 1. The existing knowledge for association to disease is high if that protein is well associated to the disease through existing knowledge. Proteins with low existing knowledge for association to disease represent suitable candidates for potential biomarkers as they represent proteins with a significant classification weight but little existing knowledge. [0134] In some embodiments, classification model weight and importance for each protein in each disease label, the definition depends on the algorithm used. The classification model weight of Table 1 is generated using Random Forest. Random Forest allows estimation of the classification model weight and importance for each protein by a number of methods, one being removing or perturbing the values. The average of the resulting changes in classification error provides an indication of weight. The classification model weights are dependent on the dataset and are relative within the dataset. For example, if a feature (protein) is removed from a data set, the weights of the other feature are recalculated when the model is retrained. For example, if the same algorithm is used on a similar but a new set of data, the weight can be different. The methods disclosed herein provide stability of important features across many independent datasets by focusing on the subset of the important features consistent across different datasets. The methods provided herein identify the subset currently not related to known knowledge as a novel biomarker. TRAINED CLASSIFICATION MODEL [0135] Present disclosure relates to methods of identifying biomarkers ( e.g ., protein) that are linked to a specified biological state (e.g., a disease state) and are present in a very low or non- recorded concentration in presently known databases. The present disclosure also relates to computer implemented machine learning classification algorithms, apparatuses, systems, and computer readable media for assessing a likelihood that a patient has the specified biological state, such as cancer, relative to a patient (test) population or a control (reference) population. Machine Learning Algorithm Based Methods [0136] The collection of data from patient samples presents a very complex network of information about the patient. This complex network of information can be effectively untangled by modern machine learning algorithms. Modem machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms are well suited to managing large quantities of heterogeneous data. [0137] The term 'machine learning' refers to algorithms that give a computer the ability to leam without being explicitly programmed including algorithms that can learn from and make predictions about data. Non-limiting exemplary machine learning algorithms include decision tree learning, artificial neural networks, deep learning neural network, support vector machines, rule base machine learning, random forest, nearest neighbor, support vector classifier, partial least square, and logistic regression. Non-limiting examples of neural networks include convolutional neural networks, deep convolutional neural networks, cascaded deep convolutional neural networks, graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN), etc. In some embodiments, algorithms such as linear regression or logistic regression can be used as part of a machine learning process. However, it is understood that using linear regression or another algorithm as part of a machine learning process is distinct from performing a statistical analysis such as regression with a spreadsheet program such as Excel. The machine learning process has the ability to continually learn and adjust the classifier as new data becomes available, and does not rely on explicit or rules-based programming. Statistical modeling relies on finding relationships between variables (e.g, mathematical equations) to predict an outcome. [0138] Machine learning has two main phases: a training phase and an application or testing phase. During training, models are learned from labelled diseases and their respective association scores. During the testing or application phase, the models are then applied to unseen data for classifying against the biological states used in training. [0139] Generating a prediction algorithm by training a machine is a well-known technique. The most important in the training of the machine is the quality of the database used for the training. Typically, the machine combines one or more linear models, support vector machines, decision trees and/or a neural network. [0140] Machine learning can be generalized as the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. Machine learning can include the following concepts and methods. Supervised learning concepts can include AODE; Artificial neural network, such as Backpropagation, Autoencoders, Hopfield networks, Boltzmann machines, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, and Spiking neural networks; Bayesian statistics, such as Bayesian network and Bayesian knowledge base; Case-based reasoning; Gaussian process regression; Gene expression programming; Group method of data handling (GMDH); Inductive logic programming; Instance-based learning; Lazy learning; Learning Automata; Learning Vector Quantization; Logistic Model Tree; Minimum message length (decision trees, decision graphs, etc.), such as Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and Analogical modeling; Probably approximately correct learning (PAC) learning; Ripple down rules, a knowledge acquisition methodology; Symbolic machine learning algorithms; Support vector machines; Random Forests; Ensembles of classifiers, such as Bootstrap aggregating (bagging) and Boosting (meta-algorithm); Ordinal classification; Information fuzzy networks (IFN); Conditional Random Field; ANOVA; Linear classifiers, such as Fisher's linear discriminant, Linear regression, Logistic regression, Multinomial logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifier, Perceptron, Support vector machines; Quadratic classifiers; k-nearest neighbor; Boosting; Decision trees, such as C4.5, Random forests, ID3, CART, SLIQ, SPRINT; Bayesian networks, such as Naive Bayes; and Hidden Markov models. Unsupervised learning concepts can include; Expectation-maximization algorithm; Vector Quantization; Generative topographic map; Information bottleneck method; Artificial neural network, such as Self-organizing map; Association rule learning, such as, Apriori algorithm, Eclat algorithm, and FP-growth algorithm; Hierarchical clustering, such as Single-linkage clustering and Conceptual clustering; Cluster analysis, such as, K-means algorithm, Fuzzy clustering, DBSCAN, and OPTICS algorithm; and Outlier Detection, such as Local Outlier Factor. Semi-supervised learning concepts can include; Generative models; Low-density separation; Graph-based methods; and Co-training. Reinforcement learning concepts can include; Temporal difference learning; Q-learning; Learning Automata; and SARSA. Deep learning concepts can include; Deep belief networks; Deep Boltzmann machines; Deep Convolutional neural networks; Deep Recurrent neural networks; and Hierarchical temporal memory. [0141] In some embodiments, the present systems and methods relate to generating a trained classification model by assigning classification model weight and existing knowledge association score. In some embodiments, the variables used to train the machine comprise the expression level of biomolecules ( e.g ., protein) from a sample. In the present disclosure, the machine learning algorithms are 'trained' by building a trained classification model from inputs. The inputs can be retrospective data with a known diagnosis of cancer (including matched controls) and data from measured biomarkers and clinical factors of those patients. In some embodiments, the inputs can be complex biomolecule sampling data from a test subject who has or is currently undergoing any form of treatment (e.g., cancer treatment). In some embodiments, the subject is diagnosed with or suspected of having or developing a disease or disorder. In some embodiments, the disease is cancer. In some embodiments, the subject is in cancer remission. [0142] In some embodiments, the surface-activity relationships (i.e., intermolecular interaction modeling) of the biomarkers identified and the corona which captured them are stored in a relational database and applied to a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) to rationally design coronas with features configured to target specific biomarkers which may be relevant to a disease state. [0143] In some embodiments, broad range sampling of complex biomolecules without any prior depletion generates a large training data set and test data set of disease labeled biomolecules (e.g, protein) across many patient samples. The trained machine learning algorithm can assign a classification model weight to each biomolecule (e.g, protein) in the test data set and all known biomolecules for a specified biological state (e.g, cancer). The classification strength of the biomolecules can be determined by assigning an existing knowledge association score (FIG. 2). The classification strength of a biomolecule (e.g, protein as a biomarker of a cancer) can classify a biomarker into a category indicative of a likelihood that the biomarker plays a role in the specified biological state (e.g, a disease state). The categories can be divided into four subgroups: (1) having a significant classification model weight but with little existing knowledge association for a specified biological state (e.g, a disease state) (the lower right quadrant of FIG. 2); (2) having a significant classification model weight with well-known existing knowledge association for a specified biological state (e.g, a disease state) (the upper right quadrant of FIG. 2); (3) having a weak classification model weight with little existing knowledge association for a specified biological state (e.g, a disease state) (the lower left quadrant of FIG. 2); and (4) having a weak classification model weight with well-known existing knowledge association for a specified biological state (e.g, a disease state) (the upper left quadrant of FIG. 2). The biomolecules assigned to a category of having a significant classification model weight but with little existing knowledge association for a specified biological state (e.g, a disease state) (the lower right quadrant of FIG. 2) may be novel biomarkers associated with the specified biological state. [0144] It is understood that the basis of use of the biomarkers identified by presently described methods for e.g ., early detection of cancer and/or monitoring of a treatment response to a therapy is based on, at least in part, (1) an identification of a specified biological state (e.g, a type of cancer), (2) validated biomarkers that are associated with the specified biological state, (3) clinical parameter data, and in some cases, (4) publically available data including risk factors for having the cancer. Validation of the biomarkers identified in the present methods can be provided by analyzing retrospective e.g, cancer samples along with age matched normal (e.g, non-cancer) samples and/or other controls. Specificity and Sensitivity [0145] Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of the performance of a binary classification test, also known in statistics as classification function. Sensitivity measures the proportion of positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g. the percentage of subject with a disease or disorder who are correctly identified as having the disease or disorder). Specificity measures the proportion of negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g. the percentage of subject without the disease or disorder who are correctly identified as not having the disease or disorder). Sensitivity quantifies the avoiding of false negatives, and specificity does the same for false positives. [0146] Sensitivity and specificity are prevalence-independent test characteristics, as their values are intrinsic to the test and do not depend on the disease prevalence in the population of interest. Positive and negative predictive values, but not sensitivity or specificity, are values influenced by the prevalence of disease in the population that is being tested. Bayesian clinical diagnostic model can demonstrate the positive and negative predictive values as a function of the prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity. Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' rule is used to update the probability that a hypothesis is correct as evidence is added. In clinical medicine, Bayesian methods are used to establish the probability that a patient has a particular condition given the results of the test used and the prevalence of the condition in the population tested. The probability that the subject has the condition is largely dependent on the frequency of the condition in the population tested (prevalence). This applies even if the test has a high probability of being correct (sensitivity) and a high probability of identifying the patients that do not have the condition (specificity). [0147] The tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity can be represented graphically using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. ROC curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. ROC curve analysis is often applied to measure the diagnostic accuracy of a biomarker. The analysis results in two gains: diagnostic accuracy of the biomarker and the optimal cut-point value. The ROC curve is a mapping of the sensitivity versus for all possible values of the cut-point between cases and controls. [0148] To measure the diagnostic ability of a biomarker, it is common to use summary measures such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and/or the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC). A biomarker with AUC = 1 discriminates individuals perfectly as diseased or healthy. Meanwhile, an AUC = 0.5 means that there is no apparent distributional difference between the biomarker values of the two groups. ROC analysis provides two main outcomes: the diagnostic accuracy of the test and the optimal cut-point value for the test. Cut-points dichotomize the test values, so this provides the diagnosis (diseased or not). The identification of the cut-point value requires a simultaneous assessment of sensitivity and specificity. A cut- point is referred to as optimal when the point classifies most of the individuals correctly. AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values are useful for the evaluation of a marker; however, they do not specifyâoptimalâ cut-points directly. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1 - specificity) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection in machine learning. The false-positive rate is also known as the fall-out or probability of false alarm and can be calculated as (1 - specificity). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity as a function of fall- out. In general, if the probability distributions for both detection and false alarm are known, the ROC curve can be generated by plotting the cumulative distribution function (area under the probability distribution from - Â¥ to the discrimination threshold) of the detection probability in the y-axis versus the cumulative distribution function of the false-alarm probability on the x- axis. ROC analysis provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones independently from (and prior to specifying) the cost context or the class distribution. ROC analysis is related in a direct and natural way to cost/benefit analysis of diagnostic decision making. [0149] Area under the ROC curve (AUC) means a statistic to measure classifier performance, commonly used in machine learning applications that encapsulate both sensitivity and specificity of the classifier performance. In a ROC curve, the true positive rate (sensitivity) is plotted in function of the false positive rate (1 - specificity) for different cut-off points of a parameter. Each point on the ROC curve represents a sensitivity/specificity pair corresponding to a particular decision threshold. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of how well a parameter can distinguish between two diagnostic groups (diseased/normal). [0150] Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) are the proportions of positive and negative results in statistics and diagnostic tests that are true positive and true negative results, respectively. The PPV and NPV describe the performance of a diagnostic test or other statistical measure. A high result can be interpreted as indicating the accuracy of such a statistic. Although sometimes used synonymously, a negative predictive value generally refers to what is established by control groups, while a negative post-test probability rather refers to a probability for an individual. Still, if the individualâs pre-test probability of the target condition is the same as the prevalence in the control group used to establish the negative predictive value, then the two are numerically equal.

In these methods, the first or second functional groups can include an amine group, a maleimide group, a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a pyridylthiol group, or an azide group. [0183] In certain embodiments, the nanoparticles can comprise polymers that include, for example, a sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyoxyethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyethylene imine (PEI), polylactic acid, polycaprolactone, polyglycolic acid, poly(lactide-co-glycolide polymer (PLGA), cellulose ether polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone, vinyl acetate, polyvinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), acrylate, polyacrylic acid (PAA), vinyl acetate, crotonic acid copolymers, polyacrylamide, polyethylene phosphonate, polybutene phosphonate, polystyrene, polyvinylphosphonate, polyalkylene, carboxy vinyl polymer, sodium alginate, carrageenan, xanthan gum, gum acacia, Arabic gum, guar gum, pullulan, agar, chitin, chitosan, pectin, karaya gum, locust bean gum, maltodextrin, amylose, corn starch, potato starch, rice starch, tapioca starch, pea starch, sweet potato starch, barley starch, wheat starch, hydroxypropylated high amylose starch, dextrin, levan, elsinan, gluten, collagen, whey protein isolate, casein, milk protein, soy protein, keratin, or a gelatin, or a copolymer, derivative, or mixture thereof. [0184] In other embodiments, the polymer can be or include a polyethylene, polycarbonate, polyanhydride, polyhydroxyacid, polypropylfumerate, polycaprolactone, polyamide, polyacetal, polyether, polyester, poly(orthoester), polycyanoacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane, polyphosphazene, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate, polycyanoacrylate, polyurea, polystyrene, or a polyamine, or a copolymer, derivative, or mixture thereof. [0185] In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides nanoparticles comprising biodegradable polymers. The non-limiting exemplary biodegradable polymers can be poly-b- amino-esters (PBAEs), poly(amido amines), polyesters including poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), polyanhydrides, bioreducible polymers, and other biodegradable polymers. In some embodiments, the biodegradable polymer comprises 2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethanol end- modified poly(l,4-butanediol diacrylate-co-4-amino-l -butanol), (l-(3-aminopropyl)-4- methylpiperazine end-modified poly(l,4-butanediol diacrylate-co-4-amino-l -butanol), 2-(3- aminopropylamino)ethanol end-modified poly(l,4-butanediol diacrylate-co-5-amino-l- pentanol), (l-(3-aminopropyl)-4-methylpiperazine end-modified poly(l,4-butanediol diacrylate- co-5-amino-l-pentanol), 2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethanol end-modified poly(l,5 pentanediol diacrylate-co-3 -amino- 1 -propanol), and (l-(3-aminopropyl)-4-methylpiperazine-end-modified poly(l,5 pentanediol diacrylate-co-3-amino-l-propanol). [0186] The plurality of nanoparticles can be in any suitable combination of two or more nanoparticles in which each nanoparticles provides a unique biomolecule corona signature. For example, the plurality of nanoparticles can include one or more liposome and one or more nanoparticle described herein. In one embodiment, the plurality of nanoparticles can be a plurality of liposomes with varying lipid content and/or varying charges (cationic/anionic/neutral). In another embodiment, the plurality of nanoparticles can contain one or more nanoparticle made of the same material but of varying sizes and physiochemical properties. [0187] The physicochemical properties include, but are not limited to the composition, size, surface charge, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, surface functionality (surface functional groups), surface topography, surface curvature and shape. The term composition encompasses the use of different types of materials and differences in the chemical and/or physical properties of materials, for example, conductivity of the material chosen between the sensor elements. [0188] Surface curvature is generally determined by the nanoparticle size. Thus, at a nanometer scale, as the size of the surface curvature affects the binding selectivity of the surface. For example, at certain curvature, the surface of the particle may have a binding affinity for a specific type of biomolecule where a different curvature will have a different binding affinity and/or a binding affinity for a different biomolecule. The curvature can be adjusted to create a plurality of sensor elements with altered affinity for different biomolecules. A sensor array can be created including a plurality of sensor elements having different curvatures (e.g. different sizes) which results in a plurality of sensor elements each with a different biomolecule corona signature. [0189] In another embodiment, the plurality of nanoparticles can contain one or more nanoparticle made of differing materials (e.g. silica and polystyrene) with similar or varying sizes and/or physiochemical properties (e.g. modifications, for example, -NH2, -COOH functionalization). These combinations are purely provided as examples and are non-limiting to the scope of the present disclosure. [0190] Surface morphology may also be modified by methods such as patterning the surface to provide different affinities, engineering surface curvatures on multiple length scales and the like. Patterning the surface is provided by, for example, forming the sensor elements by block polymerization in which the at least two blocks have different chemistries, forming the nanoparticles using mixtures of at least two different polymers and phase separating the polymers during polymerization, and/or cross-linking the separate polymers following phase separation. Engineered surface curvature on multiple length scales is provided, for example, by employing Pickering emulsions (Sacanna et al. 2007) stabilized by finely divided particles for the synthesis of nanoparticles. In some embodiments, finely divided particles are selected from, for example, silicates, aluminates, titanates, metal oxides such as aluminum, silicon, titanium, nickel, cobalt, iron, manganese, chromium, or vanadium oxides, carbo blacks, and nitrides or carbides, e.g., boron nitride, boron carbide, silicon nitride, or silicon carbide, among others. In some embodiments, finely divided particles can comprise an inorganic material. In some embodiments, finely divided particles can comprise an organic material. In some embodiments, finely divided particles can comprise biomolecules such as protein-based particles and oligonucleotide-based particles (RNA and/or DNA). In some embodiments, finely divided particles are selected from, for example, superparamagnetic materials such as magnetite, maghemite, etc. In some embodiments, finely divided particles are selected from a polymer, a metal oxide, a plasmonic material, a biomolecule, a superparamagnetic material, magnetite, maghemite, a micelle, a liposome, iron oxide, graphene, silica, polystyrene, silver, gold, a quantum dot, palladium, platinum, titanium, and any combination thereof. [0191] Nanoparticle elements may be functionalized to have different physicochemical properties. Suitable methods of functionalizing the sensor elements are known in the art and depend on composition of the sensor element (e.g. gold, iron oxide, silica, silver, etc.), and include, but not limited to, for example aminopropyl functionalized, amine functionalized, boronic acid functionalized, carboxylic acid functionalized, amine functionalized, boronic acid functionalized, carboxylic acid functionalized, methyl functionalized, N-succinimidyl ester functionalized, PEG functionalized, streptavidin functionalized, methyl ether functionalized, triethoxylpropylaminosilane functionalized, thiol functionalized, PCP functionalized, citrate functionalized, lipoic acid functionalized, BPEI functionalized, carboxyl functionalized, hydroxyl functionalized, and the like. In one embodiment, the nanoparticles may be functionalized with an amine group (-NH2 or a carboxyl group (COOH). In some embodiments, the nanoscale sensor elements are functionalized with a polar functional group. Non-limiting examples of the polar functional group comprise carboxyl group, a hydroxyl group, a thiol group, a cyano group, a nitro group, an ammonium group, an imidazolium group, a sulfonium group, a pyridinium group, a pyrrolidinium group, a phosphonium group or any combination thereof. In some embodiments, the functional group is an acidic functional group (e.g., sulfonic acid group, carboxyl group, and the like), a basic functional group (e.g., amino group, cyclic secondary amino group (such as pyrrolidyl group and piperidyl group), pyridyl group, imidazole group, guanidine group, etc.), a carbamoyl group, a hydroxyl group, an aldehyde group and the like. In some embodiments, the polar functional group is an ionic functional group. Non-limiting examples of the ionic function group comprise an ammonium group, an imidazolium group, a sulfonium group, a pyridinium group, a pyrrolidinium group, a phosphonium group. In some embodiments, the sensor elements are functionalized with a polymerizable functional group. Non-limiting examples of the polymerizable functional group include a vinyl group and a (meth)acrylic group. In some embodiments, the functional group is pyrrolidyl acrylate, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, acrylamide, 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and the like. [0192] In other embodiments, the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticle may be modified by modification of the surface charge. For example, the surface can be modified to provide a net neutral charge, a net positive surface charge, a net negative surface charge, or a zwitterionic charge. The charge of the surface can be controlled either during synthesis of the element or by post-synthesis modification of the charge through surface functionalization. For polymeric nanoparticles, differences in charge can be obtained during synthesis by using different synthesis procedures, different charged comonomers, and in inorganic substances by having mixed oxidation states. Arrays [0193] In some embodiments, the multi-particle enabled complex biomolecule sampling can comprise an array or a chip. In some embodiments, the multi-particle enabled complex biomolecule sampling can comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of a plurality of half particles of different geometric shapes which can be made by molding technology, 3D printing or 4D printing. Suitable half particles are known in the art, and include, but are not limited to half and partial particles in any geometric shape, for example, spheres, rods, triangles, cubes and combinations thereof. Suitably, in one embodiment, the plurality of half particles has different physicochemical properties made by 3-D printing. [0194] In some embodiments, the particles of the multi-particle enabled complex biomolecule sampling are made by 3D or 4 D printing. Suitable methods of 3D and 4D printing, including nanoscale sensor elements are known in the art. Suitable material for 3D and 4D printing include, but is not limited to, e.g ., plastics and synthetic polymers ( e.g. , poly-ethylene glycol- diacrylate (PEG-DA), poly (e-caprolactone) (PCL), polypropylene oxide (PPO), poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) etc.), metals, powders, glass, ceramics, and hydrogels. Suitable shapes made by 3D or 4D printing include, but are not limited to, for example, full or partial spheres (e.g. 3/4 or half spheres), rods, cubes, triangles or other geometrical or non-geometrical shapes. [0195] 3D printing techniques include, but are not limited to, microextrusion printing, inkjet bioprinting, laser-assisted bioprinting, stereolithography, omnidirectional printing, and stamp printing. [0196] In some embodiments, the array comprises a substrate and a plurality of nanoparticles. Regardless of the identity of the plurality of nanoparticles, this disclosure can be embodied by a matrix of plurality of nanoparticles immobilized on, connected with and/or coupled to a solid substrate. The substrate can comprise, consist essentially of or consist of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), silica, gold or gold coated substrate, silver or silver coated substrate, platinum or platinum coated substrate, zinc or zinc coated substrate, carbon coated substrate and the like. One skilled in the art would be able to select an appropriate substrate for the plurality of nanoparticles. In some embodiments, the plurality of nanoparticles and the substrate are made of the same element, for example, gold. In some embodiments, the substrate and nanoparticles form a chip. [0197] In some embodiments, the array comprises a single surface, plate or chip containing two or more discrete sensor elements (regions) with topological differences that allows for discrete biomolecule corona formation at each discrete element (region). The surface plate or chip can be fabricated to include the two or more discrete elements (regions) by the methods described herein. The discrete regions can be raised surfaces of differing geometric shapes, differing sizes or differing charges or other topological differences that result in discrete sensor elements with ability to form discrete biomolecule coronas. [0198] In some embodiments, the plurality of nanoparticles are non-covalently attached to the substrate. Suitable methods of non-covalent attachment are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, for example, metal coordination, charge interaction, hydrophobic-hydrophobic interaction, chelation and the like. In other embodiments, the plurality of nanoparticles are covalently attached to the substrate. Suitable methods of covalently linking the plurality of nanoparticles and the substrates include, but are not limited to, for example, click chemistry, irradiation, and the like. [0199] For example, the plurality of nanoparticles can be conjugated to a substrate (e.g. silica substrate) via the amidation reaction between the amino groups on silica substrate surface and carboxylic acid groups on nanoparticle surface, via the ring-opening reaction between the epoxy groups on silica substrate surface and amino groups on nanoparticle surface, via the Michael Addition reaction between the maleimide groups on silica substrate surface and thiol or amino groups on nanoparticle surface, via the urethane reaction between the isocyanate groups on silica substrate surface and hydroxyl or amino groups on nanoparticle surface, via the oxidation reaction between the thiol groups on silica substrate surface and the ones on nanoparticle surface, via theâClickâ chemistry between azide groups on silica substrate surface and alkyne groups on nanoparticle surface, via the thiol exchange reaction between 2-pyridyldithiol groups on silica substrate surface and thiol groups on nanoparticle surface, via the coordination reaction between boronic acid groups on silica substrate surface and diol groups on nanoparticle surface, via the UV light-irradiated addition reaction between C=C bonds on substrate surface and C=C bonds on nanoparticle surface and the like. Suitable methods of conjugating sensor elements to gold substrate are known in the art and include, for example, conjugation via Au-thiol bonds, via the amidation reaction between the carboxylic acid groups on gold substrate surface and the amino groups on nanoparticle surface, viaâClickâ chemistry between the azide groups on gold substrate surface and the alkyne groups on nanoparticle surface, via urethane reaction between the NHS groups on gold substrate surface and the amino groups on nanoparticle surface, via the ring-opening reaction between the epoxy groups on gold substrate surface and amino groups on nanoparticle surface, via the coordination reaction between boronic acid groups on silica substrate surface and diol groups on nanoparticle surface, via the UV light-irradiated addition reaction between C=C bonds on gold substrate surface and C=C bonds on nanoparticle surface, via theâLigand-Receptorâ interaction between biotin on gold substrate surface and avidin on nanoparticle surface, via theâHost-Guestâ interaction between a-cyclodextrin (a-CD) on gold substrate surface and adamantine (Ad) on nanoparticle surface, and the like. [0200] The plurality of nanoparticles can be attached to the substrate randomly or in a distinct pattern. The plurality of nanoparticles can be substantially uniformly positioned. The pattern of the arranged plurality of nanoparticles can vary according to the pattern in which the plurality of nanoparticles are attached to the substrate. Each nanoparticle t is separated by a distance. The distance between the nanoparticles arranged on the substrate can vary depending on the length of the linker used to attach or other fabrication conditions. According to various embodiments, the plurality of nanoparticles on the array can be fabricated having a desired inter-element distance and pattern. Suitable distinct patterns are known in the art, including, but not limited to, parallel lines, squares, circles, triangles and the like. Further, the nanoparticles can be arranged in rows, or columns. In some embodiments, the substrate is a flat substrate, in other embodiments, the substrate is in the form of microchannels or nanochannels. The plurality of nanoparticles can be contained within microchannels or nanochannels that restrict or control the flow of the sample through the sensor array. Suitable microchannels can range from 10 pm to about 100 pm in size. [0201] In some embodiments, a channel is formed by lithography, etching, embossing, or molding of a polymeric surface. In general, the fabrication process can involve one or more of any of these processes, and different parts of the array can be fabricated using different methods and assembled or bonded together. [0202] Lithography involves use of light or other form of energy such as electron beam to change a material. Typically, a polymeric material or precursor (e.g. photoresist, a light-resistant material) is coated on a substrate and is selectively exposed to light or other form of energy. Depending on the photoresist, exposed regions of the photoresist either remain or are dissolved in subsequent processing steps known generally asâdeveloping.â This process results in a pattern of the photoresist on the substrate. In some embodiments, the photoresist is used as a master in a molding process. In some embodiments, a polymeric precursor is poured on the substrate with photoresist, polymerized (i.e. cured) and peeled off. [0203] In some embodiments, the photoresist is used as a mask for an etching process. For example, after patterning photoresist on a silicon substrate, channels can be etched into the substrate using a deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) process or other chemical etching process known in the art (e.g. plasma etch, KOH etch, HF etch, etc.). The photoresist is removed, and the substrate is bonded to another substrate using one of any bonding procedures known in the art (e.g. anodic bonding, adhesive bonding, direct bonding, eutectic bonding, etc.). Multiple lithographic and etching steps and machining steps such as drilling can be included as required. [0204] In some embodiments, a polymeric substrate can be heated and pressed against a master mold for an embossing process. The master mold can be formed by a variety of processes, including lithography and machining. The polymeric substrate is then bonded with another substrate to form channels and/or a mixing apparatus. Machining processes can be included if necessary. [0205] In some embodiments, a molten polymer or metal or alloy is injected into a suitable mold and allowed to cool and solidify for an injection molding process. The mold typically consists of two parts that allow the molded component to be removed. Parts thus manufactured can be bonded to result in the substrate. [0206] In some embodiments, sacrificial etch can be used to form channels. Lithographic techniques can be used to pattern a material on a substrate. This material is covered by another material of different chemical nature. This material can undergo lithography and etch processes, or other machining process. The substrate is then exposed to a chemical agent that selectively removes the first material. Channels are formed in the second material, leaving voids where the first material was present before the etch process. [0207] In some embodiments, microchannels are directly machined into a substrate by laser machining or CNC machining. Several layers thus machined can be bonded together to obtain the final substrate. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 1 pm to approximately 1000 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 5 pm to approximately 500 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 10 pm to approximately 100 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel a ranges from approximately 25 pm to approximately 100 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 50 pm to approximately 100 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 75 pm to approximately 100 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 10 pm to approximately 75 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 10 pm to approximately 50 pm. In some embodiments, the width or height of each channel ranges from approximately 10 pm to approximately 25 pm. [0208] In some embodiments, the maximum width or height of a channel is approximately 1 pm, approximately 5 pm, approximately 10 pm, approximately 20 pm, approximately 30 pm, approximately 40 pm, approximately 50 pm, approximately 60 pm, approximately 70 pm, approximately 80 pm, approximately 90 pm, approximately 100 pm, approximately 250 pm, approximately 500 pm, or approximately 1000 pm. [0209] In some embodiments, the width of each channel ranges from approximately 5 pm to approximately 100 pm. In some embodiments, the width of a channel is approximately 5 pm, approximately 10 pm, approximately 15 pm, approximately 20 pm, approximately 25 pm, approximately 30 pm, approximately 35 pm, approximately 40 pm, approximately 45 pm, approximately 50 pm, approximately 60 pm, approximately 70 pm, approximately 80 pm, approximately 90 pm, or approximately 100 pm. [0210] In some embodiments, the height of each channel ranges from approximately 10 pm to approximately 1000 pm. In some embodiments, the height of a channel is approximately 10 pm, approximately 100 pm, approximately 250 pm, approximately 400 pm, approximately 500 pm, approximately 600 pm, approximately 750 pm, or approximately 1000 pm. In specific embodiments, the height of the channel(s) through which the sample flows is approximately 500 pm. In some embodiments, the height of the channel(s) through which the sample flows is approximately 500 pm. [0211] In some embodiments, the length of each channel ranges from approximately 100 pm to approximately 10 cm. In some embodiments, the length of a channel is approximately 100 pm, approximately 1.0 mm, approximately 10 mm, approximately 100 mm, approximately 500 mm, approximately 600 mm, approximately 700 mm, approximately 800 mm, approximately 900 mm, approximately 1.0 cm, approximately 1.1 cm, approximately 1.2 cm, approximately 1.3 cm, approximately 1.4 cm, approximately 1.5 cm, approximately 5 cm, or approximately 10 cm. In some embodiments, the length of the channel(s) through which the sample flows is approximately 1.0 cm. In some embodiments, the length of the channel(s) through which the sample flows is approximately 1.0 cm.

Kits [0214] Aspects of the present disclosure that are described with respect to methods can be utilized in the context of the sensor array or kits discussed in this disclosure. Similarly, aspects of the present disclosure that are described with respect to the sensor array and methods can be utilized in the context of the kits, and aspects of the present disclosure that are described with respect to kits can be utilized in the context of the methods and sensor array. [0215] This disclosure provides kits. The kits can be suitable for use in the methods described herein. Suitable kits include a kit for determining a biomolecule fingerprint for a sample comprising a sensor array as described herein. In one aspect, the kit provides a sensor array comprising at least two sensor elements which have differing physiocochemical properties from each other. In some aspects, the kits provides a comparative panel of biomolecule fingerprints in order to use the biomolecule fingerprint to determine a disease state for the subject. In some aspects, instructions on how to determine the biomolecule fingerprint are included. In some suitable embodiments, the sensor arrays are provided as chip arrays in the kit. [0216] In other aspects, kits for determining a disease state of a subject or diagnosing or prognosing a disease in a subject are provided. Suitable kits include a sensor array comprising at least two sensor elements which have differing physiocochemical properties from each other to determining a biomolecule fingerprint.

Instructions on determining the biomolecule fingerprint and analysis are provided. [0217] It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that many additional modifications beside those already described are possible without departing from the inventive concepts. In interpreting this disclosure, all terms should be interpreted in the broadest possible manner consistent with the context. Variations of the term 'comprising' should be interpreted as referring to elements, components, or steps in a non-exclusive manner, so the referenced elements, components, or steps may be combined with other elements, components, or steps that are not expressly referenced. Embodiments referenced as 'comprising' certain elements are also contemplated as 'consisting essentially of and 'consisting of those elements. The term 'consisting essentially of and 'consisting of should be interpreted in line with the MPEP and relevant Federal Circuit's interpretation. The transitional phrase 'consisting essentially of limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps 'and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s)' of the claimed invention. 'Consisting of is a closed term that excludes any element, step or ingredient not specified in the claim. EXAMPLES [0218] These examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and not to limit the scope of the claims provided herein. EXAMPLE 1. Algorithm-Based Broad Dynamic Range Sampling of Proteome [0219] Multi-nanoparticle proteomic sampling was performed with three different cross- reactive liposomes with various surface charges (i.e., cationic DOPG (l,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3- phospho-(l'-rac-glycerol)), anionic (DOTAP(l,2-Dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane)- DOPE(dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine)), and neutral (CHOL (DOPC-Cholesterol), as described in International Patent Application PCT/US2017/067013, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. The protein composition at the surface of three liposomes was evaluated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in which the abundance of 850+ known proteins was defined. The bottom plot of FIG. 3 shows all 850+ proteins detected in the broad range proteome sampling. Of these, proteins with no known plasma concentration were identified for each type of nanoparticles. [0220] Machine learning classification algorithms ( e.g ., Partial Least Squares, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Nearest Neighbor, or Random Forest) were applied to these proteins to build a trained classification model. The features of individual proteins were extracted by the trained classification model and associated classification weights were generated and stored as a set of data. Another data set was created by querying data aggregators such as Open Targets, Gene Ontology Consortium and commercial options for all known biomolecules (e.g., proteins or expressing genes) connected with cancer and their respective association score. The classification strength of the protein to its strength of associations in public and private databases to the labeled diseases was compared for the set of potential biomarkers. The lower right quadrant of FIG. 2 represents proteins that have a significant weight in the classification but with little existing knowledge associating the proteins to the specified disease. Therefore, these proteins are suitable candidates for novel biomarkers. The upper left quadrant of FIG. 2 represents proteins that have a large body of evidence linking them to the disease but weak classification weights. These proteins could represent either a common mechanism or set of mechanisms for multiple diseases which the classification weights cannot differentiate, or alternatively, could represent a weak role in the classification of the disease. The upper right and lower left quadrants help support the validity of the classification model. [0221] The top plot of FIG. 3 represents the top 50 proteins (Table 2) with a strong association with cancer classification, ordered in descending classification model weight. The existing knowledge for association to disease was determined to be high if a particular protein was associated to cancer through existing knowledge and exceeded a threshold association score. Proteins with low existing knowledge for association to disease represent suitable candidates for potential biomarkers as they represent proteins with a significant classification weight but little existing knowledge. Table 2. Proteins with a strong classification weight and a low existing knowledge association score * Association score is a maximum score from Open Targets against cancer and all child disease in the EFO ontology
