            Motivation
            Gene panel data provides critical insights into disease-gene correlations. However, aggregating and interrogating this diverse dataset can be challenging. PanelAppRex addresses this by first preparing a machine-readable aggregate and second by offering a sophisticated natural search interface that streamlines data exploration for both clinical and research applications.
          
          
            Results
            PanelAppRex aggregates gene panel data from source including Cli-Var, UniProt, and Genomics England (GE)’s PanelApp, including the approved panels used in the NHS National Genomic Test Directory and the 100,000 Genomes Project. It enables users to execute complex queries by gene names, phenotypes, disease groups and more, returning integrated datasets in multiple downloadable formats. Benchmarking demonstrates 93\% - 100\% accuracy, effectively simplifying variant discovery and interpretation to enhance workflow efficiency. The greatest benefit is the analysis ready format for bioinformatic integration.

            Motivation
            Qualifying variants (QVs) are genomic alterations selected by defined criteria within analysis pipelines. Although crucial for both research and clinical diag-nostics, QVs are often seen as simple filters rather than dynamic elements that influence the entire workflow. While best practices follow variant classification standards and standardised workflows, a unified framework to integrate and optimise QVs for advanced applications is missing.
          
          
            Results
            Our aim is to embed the concept of a “QV” into the genomic analysis vernacular, moving beyond a single filtering step. By decoupling QV criteria from other pipeline variables and code, our approach facilitates easier discussion and application. Our framework, with its new terminology and reference model, offers a flexible approach for integrating QVs into analysis pipelines, thereby enhancing reproducibility, interpretability, and interdisciplinary communication. A validation case study implementing ACMG criteria in a disease cohort shows that our approach matches conventional methods while offering improved clarity and scalability.

            We present a framework to quantify the prior probability of observing known disease-causing variants across all genes and inheritance modes. First, we computed genome-wide occurrence probabilities by integrating population allele frequencies, variant classifications, and Hardy-Weinberg expectations under autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked inheritance. Second, both pathogenic variants and missing causal candidates were tested to identify the most likely genetic disease determinant and provide a clear confidence range for the overall diagnosis. This provided a complete and interpretable summary of evidence for genetic diagnosis. Third, we summarised variant probabilities for 557 genes responsible for inborn errors of immunity (IEI), now integrated into a public database. Fourth, we derived new data-driven IEI classifications using protein-protein interactions and curated clinical features, aligned to immunophenotypes. Finally, we validated the framework in national-scale co-horts, showing close concordance with observed case numbers. The resulting datasets supported causal variant interpretation and evidence-aware decision-making in clinical genetics.

	abstract = {Abstract
          We present a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that uses established genomic metrics – such as the GuRu score, variant/gene risk priors, and population frequency – to estimate the probability of observing a given genetic variant in disease. Importantly, our approach does not directly predict variant pathogenicity; instead, it quantifies the cumulative evidence supporting a variant’s clinical observability within a Bayesian context. Using simulated genetic data with a range of variability and label noise, we systematically evaluated the actor-critic algorithm performance across multiple scenarios, employing metrics including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots, and learning dynamics. Results indicate predictive accuracy and effective learning, demonstrating RL’s potential as a practical tool for genomic variant interpretation, setting the stage for integration into a broader Bayesian classification framework.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Variant set association tests (VSAT), especially those incorporating rare variants via variant collapse, are invaluable in genetic studies. However, unlike Manhattan plots for single-variant tests, VSAT statistics lack intrinsic genomic coordinates, hindering visual interpretation. To overcome this, we developed the Archipelago method, which assigns a meaningful genomic coordinate to VSAT P values so that both set-level and individual variant associations can be visualised together. This results in an intuitive and information rich illustration akin to an archipelago of clustered islands, enhancing the understanding of both collective and individual impacts of variants. In a validation study using 504 East Asian subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (250 cases, 254 controls), we first conducted a single-variant GWAS using logistic regression with Firth correction. We then performed an equivalent case/control analysis by collapsing variants into protein pathways (defined via STRINGdb and PreoMCLustR) and testing associations with SKAT-O. The Archipelago plot is applicable in any genetic association study that uses variant collapse to evaluate both individual variants and variant sets, and its customizability facilitates clear communication of complex genetic data. By integrating at least two dimensions of genetic data into a single visualization, VSAT results can be easily read and aid in identification of potential causal variants in variant sets such as protein pathways.},
