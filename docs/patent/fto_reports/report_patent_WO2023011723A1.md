#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Methods for identifying somatic variants from sequence data are described, the method accounting for tumour in normal contamination to improve the sensitivity of variant calling when tumour in normal contamination is expected. The methods comprise receiving sequence data from one or more tumour samples of a subject and one or more normal samples, identifying one or more sites where the sequence data from the one or more tumour samples is indicative of a difference between the tumour genome and a reference genome, and determining whether each of the one or more identified sites is a somatic variant using the sequence data from the one or more normal samples and a probabilistic model that models the presence of tumour genetic material in the one or more normal samples."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of a **probabilistic/Bayesian model** that integrates data from tumour and matched normal samples, explicitly modeling **tumour-in-normal (TiN) contamination** in the normal sample.
- Calculation of **posterior probabilities** for joint genotypes (germline and tumour) to determine somatic vs germline variants.
- Use of **prior probabilities** for somatic and germline variants, incorporating known population SNP databases (dbSNP, 1000 Genomes, ExAC).
- Modeling **variant allele fractions (VAFs)** in tumour and normal samples accounting for contamination and copy number variations.
- Application of **filters** (proximal gap, mapping quality, strand bias, read depth) in conjunction with probabilistic modeling to improve variant calling sensitivity and specificity.
- Use of pileup data or summarized read counts to estimate likelihoods without requiring per-base quality scores.
- The approach explicitly integrates **true positive (TP) and false negative (FN)** considerations via posterior probabilities and contamination estimates.
- The method estimates **aberrant cell fractions** (tumour purity) in tumour and normal samples, akin to the Quant approach of integrating observed and unobserved variant data.
- Provides a framework for computing likelihoods of observing somatic variants while accounting for potential false negatives caused by contamination.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focusses primarily on **somatic variant calling in cancer samples with tumour-in-normal contamination**, specifically improving sensitivity and specificity in that context.
- Quant’s novelty lies in deriving **genome-wide prior probabilities for disease-causing variants** and integrating these priors with patient-level observed and missing variant data to compute a **Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis**, including credible intervals reflecting diagnostic certainty.
- The patent does not disclose or emphasize methods to quantify the **probability of a complete genetic diagnosis**, nor does it address genome-wide prior probabilities or mode of inheritance integration.
- The patent’s **Bayesian model is focused on the specific problem of distinguishing somatic from germline variants in contaminated samples**, rather than estimating confidence of a genetic diagnosis incorporating false negatives across a broad set of genes and inheritance modes.
- The patent discusses only **variant-level somatic vs germline classification**, without aggregating variant-level probabilities to gene-level or patient-level disease probabilities.
- The technical problem and solution target tumour variant calling, whereas Quant targets **rare disease germline genetic diagnosis across all genes and inheritance modes**.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:**  
While both Quant and WO2023011723A1 utilize Bayesian probabilistic models incorporating prior probabilities and observed variant data, this patent specifically addresses somatic variant calling challenges under tumour-in-normal contamination conditions in cancer genomes. It does not extend to or emphasize genome-wide disease-causing variant prior probability estimation, integrating unobserved variant data (false negatives) across inherited disease genes, nor does it compute a posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis with credible intervals as Quant does.

The emphasis on somatic versus germline variant classification in a tumour-normal sequencing context is distinct from Quant’s novel framework to quantify confidence of inherited genetic diagnoses by integrating population priors, clinical variant databases, and sequencing detection uncertainties. The technical overlap is limited to the Bayesian approach and some probabilistic modeling of variant allele fractions, which are common in genomics and not novel or blocking for Quant’s unique purpose and claims.

No claims or descriptions disclose calculating genome-wide prior probabilities of observing pathogenic variants under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium or deriving posterior probabilities at the patient/genome level for diagnostic confidence—as Quant uniquely provides. Therefore, there is no material blocking of Quant’s novel technology by this patent.
