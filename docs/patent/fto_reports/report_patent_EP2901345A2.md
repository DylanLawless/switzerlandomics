#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The method for genome analysis translates the clinical findings in the patient into a comprehensive test order for genes that can be causative of the patient's illness, delimits analysis of variants identified in the patient's genome to those that are 'on target' for the patient's illness, and provides clinical annotation of the likely causative variants for inclusion in a variant warehouse that is updated as a result of each sample that is analyzed... The method uses a genome sequence having the steps of entering at least one clinical feature of a patient by an end-user, assigning a weighted value to the term based on the probability of the presence of the term, mapping the term to at least one disease by accessing a knowledge base containing associations between clinical features, diseases, genes and variants... to provide a list of results of possible diagnoses prioritized based on the truth values."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses a system that integrates clinical features (phenotypes) with genome sequencing data to prioritize candidate disease-causing variants and diseases.
- Use of weighted truth values for clinical features and association mappings in a knowledge base to probabilistically rank diseases and related genes.
- Mapping of clinical features to diseases, diseases to genes, and genes to variants in combination with genome sequence data for diagnosis.
- Inclusion of a self-learning module that updates associations based on new patient data to improve accuracy.
- Utilization of variant prioritization tools based on allele frequency, functional annotation, gene-disease relevance.
- Algorithms incorporate probabilistic or fuzzy logic to handle incomplete or uncertain data in mapping and diagnosis.
- Consideration of inheritance patterns, clinical presentation, variant effect prediction, and genealogical information.
- Automated pipeline with software modules (SSAGA, RUNES, VIKING) that filter and prioritize variants relevant to the patient's phenotype.
- Rapid turnaround genome analysis (24-50 hours) for clinical diagnosis in acute settings.
- Techniques for handling large genomic rearrangements difficult to detect by standard sequencing.
- Use of standardized vocabularies (HPO, OMIM, SNOMED-CT) for clinical feature representation and computational mapping.
- Integration of multiple variant calling pipelines to improve sensitivity and specificity of variant detection.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on integrating phenotype data with variant interpretation primarily to prioritize and classify variants relevant to diagnosis, but it does not explicitly disclose:
  - Calculating genome-wide prior probabilities for disease-causing variants across all genes under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
  - Explicit statistical modeling or Bayesian integration of prior probabilities with observed and missing (false negative) variant data to compute a **posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis** with credible intervals.
  - Quantification of false negative probabilities for unobserved or unsequenced genomic regions as part of the diagnostic confidence estimation.
  - Aggregation of variant-level probabilities to gene-level and disease-level probabilities using Bayesian frameworks integrating mode of inheritance.
  - Producing explicit posterior probability values expressing the **confidence and uncertainty** of a patient's genetic diagnosis rather than only ranking or classification.
- The system primarily outputs prioritized candidate genes/variants/diseases based on mappings and truth values, but does not appear to systematically model or quantify **diagnostic certainty and genome-wide variant observation probability** that is fundamental to Quant.
- Use of Bayesian methods is mentioned generally for variant genotyping (e.g. GATK genotype likelihoods), but not for integrating prior gene/disease variant probabilities with patient-specific observed and unobserved variant data for diagnosis probability.
- The described method relies heavily on database-driven associations and variant interpretation rules without the distinctive incorporation of false negative modeling or prior probability weighting over the whole genome variant distribution.
- No mention of a method to generate credible intervals or confidence intervals around the diagnosis probability.
- Quantâ€™s approach emphasizes a novel shift from variant pathogenicity classification alone to mathematically quantifying the **likelihood of observing disease-causing variant(s) genome-wide**, which is not explicitly claimed or described herein.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:**  
This patent presents a comprehensive phenotype-to-genotype mapping system for variant prioritization and genetic diagnosis that shares some common elements with Quant such as integrating clinical data with genomic variants, probabilistic truth values, and rapid diagnostic workflows. However, it does not teach or claim the unique Quant innovations of genome-wide prior probability calculations, Bayesian integration of variant observation including false negatives, and explicit posterior probabilities with credible intervals expressing diagnostic certainty. Therefore, though similar in domain and general concept (phenotype-assisted variant interpretation), it does not block Quant's distinctive freedom-to-operate.
