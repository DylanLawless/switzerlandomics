#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present disclosure relates to a sequencing platform and workflow that leverages machine learning algorithms in genetic assays to bypass confirmatory Sanger sequencing for high-confidence variants... generating a predicted status of each variant... classified as present, absent, or unknown... performing Sanger sequencing on variants with absence status."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent address variant evaluation in clinical genetic testing.
- Use of quality features (e.g., read count, coverage, allele frequency) from NGS data for variant assessment.
- Employing machine learning (logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to classify variant calls as true or false positives.
- Classification into presence (true positive), absence (false positive), or unknown categories.
- Workflow includes subsequent Sanger sequencing confirmation of variants predicted absent or uncertain.
- The patent describes a two-tier ML classification system to determine whether to bypass Sanger confirmation.
- The system incorporates allele frequency thresholds and complex region exclusions to decide on Sanger sequencing.
- Extensive training and validation on annotated datasets with known truths, including GIAB reference samples.
- Emphasis on reducing unnecessary Sanger confirmations while maintaining high sensitivity for true variants.

#### Key Differences

- Quant’s core novelty lies in **calculating genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and integrating these priors into Bayesian posterior probabilities, explicitly modeling false negatives to quantify diagnostic confidence.**  
- The patent focuses on **classifying individual variant calls as true or false positives based solely on NGS quality metrics and machine learning models trained to predict variant correctness.**  
- No indication in the patent of **integrating prior probabilities of pathogenic variants genome-wide or modeling diagnostic certainty at the gene or patient-disease level.**  
- The patent’s aim is **Sanger confirmation bypass optimization**, whereas Quant’s aim is **quantifying confidence in complete genetic diagnosis including unobserved variants.**  
- Quant explicitly models inheritance modes and incorporates population-level pathogenicity priors; the patent focuses on variant-level quality features and classification.  
- No use of Bayesian posterior probabilities quantifying the confidence of a complete genetic diagnosis accounting for true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.  
- The patent does not claim or describe providing credible intervals reflecting diagnostic certainty.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Rationale:**  
While superficially both technologies deal with variant classification and managing false positives/negatives in sequencing data, this patent’s innovation is machine learning-based variant call classification for targeted Sanger sequencing confirmation decisions. Quant’s distinct methodology of integrating genome-wide prior probabilities and a Bayesian posterior diagnostic probability—including explicit false negative modeling and credible intervals for diagnosis confidence—represents a conceptual and technical advancement not mirrored by this patent. Therefore, despite some terminology overlap (e.g., true positive, false positive variants), the fundamental theory and technical solution differ substantially, resulting in no blocking risk for Quant.
