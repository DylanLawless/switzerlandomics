#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention pertains to a process for determining reliability of forensic interpretation methods. Specifically, the process comprises the steps of obtaining forensic data, a known feature, and a population of features; obtaining a forensic interpretation method that is applicable to the forensic data; applying the interpretation method to the forensic data to obtain an inferred feature; computing a match information statistic that determines a frequency of occurrence of a match between the inferred feature and the known feature relative to the population of features; and computing a numerical reliability statistic from the match information statistic to determine the reliability of the forensic interpretation method for legal admissibility in a court of law."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent uses a Bayesian-like probabilistic framework to interpret forensic DNA data, incorporating:
  - Prior probabilities derived from population allele/genotype frequencies (Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium assumptions).
  - Posterior inference of genotypes from observed data.
  - Calculations involving probabilities of true matches versus random matches within a population—analogous to likelihood ratios.
- Usage of population frequency data to compute match information statistics (logarithm of match likelihood ratios).
- Modeling uncertainty and multiple possible genotype states with assigned probabilities rather than deterministic genotype calls.
- Handling observed data and uncertain/mixed data to produce probabilistic inference with quantified uncertainty.
- Aggregation of locus-specific match information via log-sum formulation (additivity of information across loci).
- Quantitative measures of reliability (e.g., accuracy, precision, reproducibility) derived from statistical analysis of match information scores.
- Statistical validation framework grounded in repeated measures and error rates (false positives/negatives indirectly discussed).
- The patent addresses interpretation of observed data (DNA STR profiles) and uncertainty about the correct genotype—similar to Quant’s concept of integrating observed data with probabilistic genotype calls.
- Both Quant and the patent rely on population genetics principles to estimate prior probabilities.
- Computation of posterior probabilities given observed data and priors.
- The patent’s match information statistic corresponds in principle to the logarithm of likelihood ratios comparing observation versus population frequency, analogous to Quant’s use of odds ratios for variant observation.
- Handling of uncertain or missing data through probability distributions over possible genotypes corresponds loosely to management of possible false negatives or unobserved variants in Quant.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on forensic DNA STR profile interpretation and validation of forensic interpretation methods for legal admissibility; the domain is forensic genetics, not clinical or genome-wide diagnostic genetics.
- Quant is designed for genome-wide variant pathogenicity probability estimation across all genes and inheritance modes, integrating clinical variant data and sequencing uncertainty.
- Quant explicitly incorporates false negative (FN) probabilities related to missing or unsequenced variant data to estimate the confidence in a **complete genetic diagnosis**—the patent does not address false negatives or completeness of diagnosis.
- The patent revolves around match information for **individual identification**, i.e., comparing inferred forensic genotypes to known profiles, not estimating disease-causing variant probabilities or genetic diagnosis certainty.
- Quant integrates clinical databases (e.g., ClinVar, PanelApp) and functional annotations to derive prior, gene-level, and posterior disease probabilities; the patent does not involve clinical annotation or genetic disease prior probabilities.
- Quant models variant observation probabilities under different modes of inheritance explicitly; the patent focuses on STR genotype inference, not modes of inheritance or pathogenicity.
- The patent’s reliability statistics (accuracy, precision, reproducibility) describe repeatability and reliability of human or computer interpretation methods in forensic science rather than providing probabilistic clinical diagnostic certainty.
- The patent does not employ TP, FP, FN classification terminology or methods analogous to Quant's detailed Bayesian integration of observed and unobserved variants for disease diagnosis confidence.
- No mention or conceptual equivalent of credible intervals or genome-wide aggregation of probabilities as seen in Quant.
- The patent's match information statistic is a general likelihood ratio for identification; Quant’s method calculates **Bayesian posterior probabilities** of **correct genetic diagnosis**, a more complex and unique integration.
- Quant is designed for clinical and research use for genetic diagnosis and risk assessment, whereas the patent focuses on validation and admissibility of forensic interpretation methods.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

While the patent extensively covers Bayesian inference, prior frequency-based matching, and reliability assessment methods for forensic DNA interpretation, it fundamentally targets a different domain (forensic identification via STR profiles) and different problem space (validating interpretation reliability and match information). Its concepts of match probabilities and population genetics overlap at a theoretical level but do not infringe or block Quant’s unique Bayesian approach for directly quantifying confidence in a complete genetic diagnosis by integrating prior genome-wide variant probabilities with observed/missing patient variant data and inheritance mode modeling. The patent neither addresses false negative variant missingness nor the clinical interpretation focus of Quant.
