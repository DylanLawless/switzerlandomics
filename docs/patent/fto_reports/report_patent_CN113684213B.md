#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The invention provides a MYO15A gene mutant and application thereof. A genetic mutation is provided having a c.2802_2812delTCCCACCCAAC mutation and/or a c.5681T > C mutation compared to the wild-type MYO15A gene. By detecting whether the gene mutation exists in a biological sample, whether the biological sample suffers from non-syndrome type deafness can be effectively detected."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- This patent relates to identifying specific mutations on the MYO15A gene causative of autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness.
- It includes methods for detecting these mutations by PCR, sequencing, or reagents, and kits for diagnosis.
- The patent focuses on detecting presence/absence of specific single-gene pathogenic mutations as markers for disease.
- This involves standard genetic diagnostic methods: variant detection, family segregation analysis, and design of mutation-specific probes/primers.
- The technology is centered on molecular diagnostics identifying specific mutations causally linked with disease.

#### Key Differences

- The patent does NOT describe or claim any method for probabilistic or statistical genome-wide modeling of variant pathogenicity or disease likelihood.
- There is no discussion or implementation of integrating prior probabilities of pathogenic variants genome-wide or for all genes.
- The patent does not address modeling false negatives, missing variants, or Bayesian posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis.
- There is no theory or method of aggregating variant-level data into gene-level or diagnosis-level probabilistic confidence intervals.
- The technology relates narrowly to detecting specific mutations for a single-gene disease, not a framework for genome-wide quantitative disease probability.
- Public gene/variant databases or variant pathogenicity classification approaches are not the focus here.
- The patent is limited to a diagnostic marker for autosomal recessive deafness caused by compound heterozygous mutations in MYO15A.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

## Overall Assessment

This patent is focused on detecting and diagnosing disease based on specific MYO15A mutations associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic deafness. It describes mutation detection via molecular biology techniques and development of diagnostic kits.

In contrast, Quantâ€™s core invention involves a genome-wide Bayesian framework that integrates prior probabilities derived from population data and clinical databases, together with observed patient variant calls, to estimate the posterior probability and credible intervals of a complete genetic diagnosis. Quant uniquely addresses the uncertainty due to false negatives and genome-wide variant distributions, which is absent in this patent.

Therefore, this patent does not disclose or claim methods similar or closely resembling the theoretical basis or computational framework of Quant. Since it does not cover uncertainty quantification, Bayesian posterior derivation for diagnosis confidence, or genome-wide prior integration, it does not pose a blocking risk in the freedom-to-operate context for Quant.
