## Patent/Publication Analysis

### Reference #1

- **Title:** Treatment of Patients with Familial Hypercholesterolemia on Lipid-Lowering Therapy  
- **Publication No.:** US20180250251A1  
- **Publication Date:** 2018-09-06  
- **Link:** https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180250251A1/en  

#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Methods for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, compound heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia by administering gemcabene as an adjunct to other lipid lowering therapy and/or modified diet."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent relates to genetic conditions (familial hypercholesterolemia) including specific genotypes such as homozygous, heterozygous, and compound heterozygous states.
- Mentions genetic confirmation and clinical diagnosis of these conditions.
- Discusses treatment regimens and dosing of gemcabene in combination with existing lipid-lowering therapies.
- Includes genetic testing to confirm mutation status and interpret genotype-phenotype correlations.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on methods of treating hypercholesterolemia using a pharmaceutical compound (gemcabene), emphasizing effectiveness in lowering LDL-C levels.
- No computational methods or software frameworks for quantifying probabilities of variants or genetic diagnosis confidence are disclosed.
- Does not address or mention Bayesian posterior probabilities, integration of true positives/false negatives, nor genome-wide prior probability modeling.
- Clinical trial data and pharmacokinetics focus on lipid profile changes, safety, and dosing rather than genetic variant pathogenicity assessment or diagnosis confidence.
- No mention of variant-level or gene-level probabilistic scoring or inference.
- Does not incorporate genetic variant observation probabilities or credible intervals regarding disease-causing variants.
- Does not disclose or claim any mathematical, statistical, or computational model related to variant classification beyond clinical/genetic mutation confirmation for patient selection.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** This patent exclusively claims pharmaceutical methods for treating familial hypercholesterolemia patients using gemcabene in combination with lipid-lowering therapy. Its focus is therapeutic and clinical, centered on LDL-C reduction and dosing. It does not disclose or claim any computational methods or models that quantify prior or posterior probabilities of pathogenic variants, nor uses Bayesian integration of observed/missing variant data to assess diagnosis confidence. Therefore, it does not overlap with the core technical innovation of Quant.
