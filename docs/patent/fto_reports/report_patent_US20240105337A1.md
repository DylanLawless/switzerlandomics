#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A computer implementable system manages genetic information associated with a human genome of a target subject and displayed via a graphical user interface (GUI). The target subject genetic information is encrypted. The system compares the clinical data of the target subject with clinical data in its database to provide a first ranking of possible genetic diseases. Then the genetic information of the target subject is compared to the genetic information in the database to re-rank via a weight score evaluation based on predetermined criteria thereby providing a second ranking of possible genetic diseases... selectively decrypting portions of the genome related to the possible genetic diseases and blocking decryption of the rest of the genome."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The system ranks possible genetic diseases based on phenotype-first analysis (first ranking) followed by re-ranking using genetic variant data (second ranking).
- Weight scores are assigned to variants based on predetermined clinical and genetic criteria, including variant pathogenicity, inheritance patterns, evolutionary conservation, and statistical analyses such as Bayesian, LOD, and TDT.
- Encrypted genomic data are accessed without direct exposure to raw variants; only relevant portions are decrypted according to the ranking.
- Displays genetic disease ranking and related genome portions via a GUI.
- Integrates clinical phenotypes with genetic variants to output prioritized disease lists.
- Provides clustering of patient profiles based on clinical and genetic similarity.
- Utilizes scoring systems to weight evidence from both phenotypes and genotypes.
- Includes provisions for managing access and monitoring user activity for privacy and security.
- Bayesian analysis and statistical methods are mentioned for association strength estimation.
  
#### Key Differences

- The patent does not specify integrating prior probabilities of variant occurrence under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or explicitly quantifying probabilities of false negatives (FNs) in sequencing data.
- It does not appear to compute genome-wide prior probabilities of observing pathogenic variants per gene nor produce a Bayesian posterior probability reflecting diagnostic certainty that explicitly integrates observed true positives (TP) and unobserved FNs.
- The focus is on ranking diseases based on phenotype and adjusting rankings based on variant weight scores (including statistical associations), rather than calculating a diagnostic posterior probability or credible intervals of confidence.
- The patent relies primarily on weighted scoring and clustering rather than probabilistic modeling that quantitatively integrates population allele frequencies with observed/missing variant data.
- While Bayesian analysis is mentioned as a tool for variant-pathogenicity association strength, it is not linked clearly to the unique diagnosis confidence probabilities combining priors and observed variant calls.
- The patent broadly covers privacy and access control, graphical user interface display, and encrypted genome data management, which is peripheral to Quant’s core probabilistic methodology.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
This patent describes a system ranking possible genetic diseases by combining phenotype-first prioritization with genomic variant scores, displaying ranked lists and selectively decrypting relevant genomic regions. Although Bayesian analysis and statistical methods are mentioned for variant scoring, the system fundamentally differs from Quant's novel approach of calculating genome-wide prior probabilities for variants based on population data and inheritance modes, integrating observed/missing variant evidence as true positives and false negatives to compute a Bayesian posterior probability of a molecular diagnosis with associated credible intervals. The patent’s emphasis on weighted scoring and clustering, rather than explicit probabilistic modeling incorporating sequencing uncertainty, reflects a different theoretical and methodological framework. Therefore, there is no close overlap that would block Quant’s core innovation.
