#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Methods and kits used for determining predisposition and/or diagnosis of schizophrenia, using genotypes in the DGCR2 locus are disclosed. Also disclosed are methods and drugs for treating schizophrenia. Further disclosed are methods and kits useful for prediction of drug responsiveness towards mental disorders drugs, and more specifically towards schizophrenia drugs."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent utilize genetic variant data for disease diagnosis purposes.
- This patent focuses on determining predisposition to schizophrenia by identifying presence or absence of specific SNP genotypes in the DGCR2 locus and related loci.
- The patent discloses methods of associating particular SNP alleles and haplotypes with disease risk and drug responsiveness (e.g., zuclopenthixol, olanzapine).
- It applies genotyping assays, population association studies, and statistical evaluation of genotype-phenotype correlations.
- The patent includes claims of using genotypes to predict schizophrenia risk and drug response.
- Both utilize statistical associations of genetic variants with disease phenotypes.

#### Key Differences

- The patent is narrowly focused on schizophrenia genetics, specifically DGCR2 locus SNPs and their associations.
- It does not disclose or suggest a computational or Bayesian framework integrating prior probabilities, observed/missing variant data, or false negative probabilities across the genome.
- The patent’s approach is based on genotyping specific variants and haplotypes to classify or predict disease risk and drug response, rather than quantifying genome-wide prior probabilities or calculating a Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis.
- There is no indication of modeling Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium genome-wide or Bayesian integration of multiple modes of inheritance.
- The patent does not address quantification of diagnostic certainty with credible intervals.
- No mention or use of true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), or incorporation of uncertain or missing data into a posterior probability as in Quant.
- The technology is more about detecting association and offering a diagnostic kit, rather than a probabilistic diagnostic framework.
- The patent does not cover genome-wide analyses or diverse inheritance modes beyond DGCR2 schizophrenia association.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Rationale:** This patent discloses genotyping and association of DGCR2 locus SNPs with schizophrenia risk and drug responsiveness, but it does not disclose or suggest the unique Bayesian probabilistic framework of Quant that integrates genome-wide prior probabilities, observed and missing variant data (including false negatives), Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium modeling, inheritance modes, and posterior probability estimates with uncertainty. The patent’s scope is limited to genetic association and diagnostic kits for schizophrenia based on specific locus variants, without overlapping with Quant’s core innovations of genome-wide Bayesian variant probability quantification and diagnostic confidence.
