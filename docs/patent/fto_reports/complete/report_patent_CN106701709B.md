#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The invention discloses ATM gene mutants and applications thereof... The isolated nucleic acid encoding an ATM gene mutant, compared with SEQ ID NO: 1, has at least one mutation selected from the group consisting of: c.4777-2A>T, c.3078G>T, c.7983_7985delTGT and c.477_481delATCTC. By detecting whether the mutant is present in a biological sample, whether the biological sample is susceptible to ataxia telangiectasia can be effectively detected."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses specific ATM gene variants (mutations) associated with ataxia telangiectasia (an autosomal recessive disorder) and methods for screening biological samples for these mutations.
- The technical concept is molecular diagnosis through detection of defined pathogenic variants by sequencing or PCR amplification using specific primers/probes.
- The disclosed system includes nucleic acid extraction, amplification, sequencing or targeted mutation detection probes, and interpretation based on presence/absence of these mutations.
- The patent relates to genetic testing and variant detection specifically targeted on mutations at defined nucleotide positions in ATM.
  
#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on **identification and screening of specific pathogenic mutations in ATM gene** through standard molecular biology methods (PCR, sequencing, probe hybridization).
- It does **not describe or claim methods for genome-wide disease-causing variant probability estimation or prior probability computation**.
- There is no mention or teaching of:
  - Calculating prior probabilities of pathogenic variant occurrence across genes.
  - Integrating observed and unobserved variant data (false negatives) to compute a Bayesian posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis.
  - Providing credible intervals or uncertainty estimates on genetic diagnosis confidence.
  - Modeling mode of inheritance to adjust genome-wide variant observation probabilities.
- The patent embodies a classical genotype-phenotype correlation approach by detecting known mutations and making a binary susceptibility call without probabilistic modeling.
- Although the mutations relate to a recessive inheritance pattern and the patent indicates compound heterozygosity, it does not provide a generalized Bayesian framework or any genome-wide scalable method such as Quant.
- Use of public sequence databases (reference to SEQ ID NOs) is limited to defining the wild-type versus mutant allele sequence; no use of population allele frequency data to calculate disease probabilities.
- The patent does not address missing variant data or uncertainty due to unsequenced regions.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

---

**Summary:** This patent discloses novel mutation sites in the ATM gene linked to ataxia telangiectasia and methods for detecting these mutations through nucleic acid assays and sequencing. It is focused on mutation identification and hereditary disease screening for a specific gene and disorder. Quant's novel approach of Bayesian integration of genome-wide prior probabilities with patient-observed and missing variant data to generate a posterior probability of a full genetic diagnosis is distinct and not taught or claimed in this patent. Therefore, this patent does not block Quantâ€™s technology or methods.
