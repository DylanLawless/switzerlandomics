#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention relates to a method for the diagnosis and/or classification of a disease in a subject based on the genetic and/or epigenetic information of a sample obtained from the subject, the method comprising the steps of: a) providing data from said sample, wherein said data comprises genetic and/or epigenetic information of a random subset of genomic positions; b) assigning said sample to a sample class based on genetic and/or epigenetic information of said random subset of genomic positions by employing a computational model, which discriminates a plurality of sample classes based on genetic and/or epigenetic information of a set of genomic positions comprising said random subset, wherein the computational model has been trained with pre-determined genetic and/or epigenetic information obtained from a plurality of pre-classified samples of known diseases and wherein said computational model processes the genetic and/or epigenetic information of a genomic position of said random subset independently of the genetic and/or epigenetic information of another genomic position of said random subset, wherein said computational model is preferably in the form of a linear classifier with independent feature sampling."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses genetic and/or epigenetic information from a random subset of genomic positions.
- Employs a computational model, preferably a linear classifier with independent feature sampling such as a Naïve Bayes classifier, logistic regression, or linear SVM.
- Processes genomic positions independently (no interaction terms), consistent with an assumption of feature independence.
- Supports sparse and shallow coverage data (random subsets), enabling real-time or near real-time diagnosis.
- The model training links event rates (e.g., methylation rates) from pre-classified samples to binary or non-binary epigenetic/genetic information via probabilistic models (Bernoulli, Poisson).
- Enables continuous updating of classification probabilities as data streams in (e.g., nanopore sequencing).
- Outputs class probabilities for disease classification with uncertainty measures.
- Specifically applied to diverse diseases including brain tumors, autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), infectious diseases, and cancer subtypes.
- Incorporates sample class-specific, position-specific weighting to improve classification accuracy.
- Discusses implementation with nanopore sequencing and real-time data streams.
- Does not rely on predefined feature subsets (no feature selection), but can handle any subset randomly obtained.
- Distinguishes itself from random forest or other interaction-based classifiers by independence assumption allowing efficient real-time analysis.
- Integrates multiple data types: SNPs, methylation, copy number, structural variants.
- Provides examples and prototype applications corroborating methodological robustness.

#### Key Differences from Quant

- Quant’s core novelty lies in genome-wide prior probability modeling of pathogenic variants plus Bayesian integration of observed/missing variants to yield posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis, explicitly accounting for false negatives and inheritance modes.
- This patent primarily addresses classification of diseases based on genetic/epigenetic patterns via linear classifiers on features from random subsets; focused on class assignment rather than estimating genome-wide prior mutation probabilities or diagnostic certainty intervals related to variant observation probabilities.
- The patent is centered on disease classification from epigenetic/genetic features (e.g. methylation) in sampled genomic positions, not on variant pathogenicity modeling or diagnosis confidence incorporating true/false positives/negatives in comprehensive variant detection.
- Does not explicitly address integration of prior probabilities under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium or per gene/inheritance mode modeling of variant pathogenicity.
- Focuses on interpreting sparse genetic/epigenetic signals for classification, particularly with nanopore sparse data streams, rather than producing a Bayesian posterior probability of harboring a causal genetic variant.
- No mention of calculating credible intervals or quantifying diagnostic certainty in terms of false negative probabilities within variant detection.
- The technical methods overlap in use of Bayesian or probabilistic classifiers and handling sparse, random subsets, but the end purpose and modeling context differ substantially.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

While there are superficial methodological overlaps in the use of Bayesian-inspired linear classifiers processing sparse genetic/epigenetic data, this patent does not teach or claim the unique Quant innovations relating to genome-wide prior probabilities of pathogenic variants, integration of observed vs. missing variant data (true/false positives/negatives), inheritance mode modeling, or quantification of diagnostic certainty via Bayesian posteriors and credible intervals. The patent’s focus on disease classification from epigenetic/genetic feature patterns does not block Quant’s specific approach to genetic diagnosis certainty.
