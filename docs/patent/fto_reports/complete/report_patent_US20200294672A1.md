#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Disclosed herein are systems and methods for the automatic re-analysis of genetic testing data. A centralized computing system can analyze genetic testing data and automatically re-analyze the genetic testing data when the centralized computing system is updated... Based on the re-analysis, a suggested diagnoses and/or treatment plans can be revised."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of a centralized computing system receiving, storing, and analyzing patient genetic testing data.
- Automated re-analysis of genetic data upon updates to software, databases, or knowledgebases.
- Generation of suggested diagnoses and treatment plans based on genetic data interpretation.
- Integration and storage of various genetic and medical data types.
- Use of genetic analysis tools and methods to detect mutations, polymorphisms, deletions, insertions, or other features of interest.
- Incorporation of multiple forms of genetic testing data (e.g., sequencing, epigenetics).
- Facilitates remote communications and genetic counseling workflow with updated interpretations.

#### Key Differences

- The claimed invention focuses on infrastructure and workflow for automated re-analysis and updating of genetic testing interpretations over time.
- Does not disclose or claim genome-wide Bayesian prior probability modeling of variants.
- Lacks any method or system that quantifies false negative rates or integrates unobserved variant probabilities to derive a posterior probability of a complete genetic diagnosis.
- No explicit use or modeling of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium probabilities for variant occurrence.
- The system outputs suggested diagnoses and treatment plans but does not quantify diagnostic confidence as a Bayesian credible interval.
- Emphasis on remote telemedicine, communication platforms, data storage, and iterative re-interpretation rather than probabilistic variant classification or diagnostic certainty.
- The claims broadly cover re-analysis triggered by software or database updates, not a novel probabilistic framework integrating prior probabilities with observed and missing variant data.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.  
This patent describes a system for re-analysis and workflow management of genetic data and diagnoses, lacking the core technical features of Quantâ€™s Bayesian integration of prior probabilities with observed and unobserved variant data to compute diagnostic certainty.
