#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Systems and methods are disclosed herein for recommending disease related content based on a disease associated with a user. A user may request his or her genetic testing data. That genetic testing data may then be used to determine which genetic disease the user may possesses. Furthermore, the genetic testing data may indicate genetically-linked offspring of the user that may also be affected by a mutation that can lead to a genetic disease. The media guidance application may then recommend disease-related content to both the user and offspring."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of genetic testing data to identify a disease associated with a user.
- Identification of genetically linked users (e.g., family members) and determination of disease likelihood for these individuals.
- Recommending disease-related content tailored to identified disease risks.
- Accessing databases of genetic data (e.g., 23andMe) and associated diseases.
- Determining user disease likelihoods and thresholds to select users for content recommendation.
- Use of user profiles and genetic data to drive downstream recommendations.
- Incorporation of user age and appropriateness of content (age-related filtering).
- Use of avatars to present disease-related information.
- Monitoring user awareness and timing for delivering disease-related content.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on recommending **media content** (videos, documentaries, articles) based on identified genetic disease risks, aiming to facilitate communication and education about diseases within families.
- The disclosed system does **not** describe or claim methods for:
  - Quantifying prior probabilities of observing disease-causing variants genome-wide.
  - Integrating prior probabilities with observed and missing variant data for Bayesian posterior probabilities of a **genetic diagnosis**.
  - Modeling Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium variant occurrence probabilities or false negative variant detection probabilities.
  - Providing credible intervals or genomic diagnosis confidence metrics.
  - Genome-wide variant probability calculation or statistical genetic modeling.
- No mention or use of Bayesian posterior integration with TP, FN, or false positive/negative assessments.
- The system is a media guidance and content recommendation platform, rather than a variant pathogenicity or genetic diagnosis certainty platform.
- The disease risk estimation appears to rely solely on reported genetic testing results and associated risk probabilities, rather than custom analytical models or genome-wide assessments.
- The application emphasizes user interface/display features and media content personalization more than genetic analytical processing.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
While the patent describes a system that uses user genetic testing data and disease associations to recommend disease-related media content to genetically linked users, it does not disclose or claim genome-wide variant prior probability estimation, Bayesian integration of observed/missing variants, or quantifying diagnostic certainty as in Quant. The patent’s methods are focused on content recommendation based on existing genetic risk data, without any overlap with Quant’s technical innovations in variant probability modeling and genetic diagnosis confidence computations.
