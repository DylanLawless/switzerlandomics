#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A system, method, and computer program product for detecting variants from sequencing data. Aligned sequencing data can be provided and filters can be applied to the aligned sequencing data. The filtered data can be used as input, and a first classifier can be applied to determine if any alteration is present beyond an expected threshold due to a sequencing error and candidate variants can be identified. The identified candidate variants can be passed through additional filters to remove false positives. A somatic status of the filtered candidate variants can be determined using a second classifier."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses Bayesian classifiers for variant detection and somatic classification, incorporating statistical tests distinguishing true variants from sequencing errors.
- Applies multiple filters (e.g., proximal gap, poor mapping, strand bias, clustered position, triallelic site, observed in control) to remove false positives.
- Employs benchmarking techniques including down-sampling and virtual tumor approaches to estimate sensitivity and specificity.
- Models allele fractions explicitly in variant detection rather than assuming a fixed heterozygous state.
- Takes sequencing data (tumor and normal) as input and outputs candidate variants classified as somatic or germline.

#### Key Differences

- Focuses on detection and filtering of variants from high-throughput sequencing data, particularly somatic mutations in cancer samples.
- Aims to maximize sensitivity and specificity of variant calling, with emphasis on low allele fraction variants and filtering sequencing artifacts.
- Does not describe or claim genome-wide prior probabilities of pathogenic variants under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium.
- Does not integrate prior probabilities with observed and missing variant data to produce Bayesian posterior probabilities of a **complete genetic diagnosis**.
- No handling or modeling of false negatives or missing variant data to quantify diagnostic confidence or credible intervals.
- Does not aggregate variant-level probabilities into gene-level or disease-level probabilities.
- Absence of explicit modeling for different modes of inheritance (autosomal dominant, recessive, X-linked).
- No mention or use of prior probabilities derived from population or clinical databases for diagnosis probabilistic inference.
- Outputs variant calls and classifications; does not provide probabilistic confidence measures about the presence/absence of a disease-causing variant in a patient.
- The Bayesian classifiers are primarily used for classification of variants as somatic/germline or true variant/noise, not for integrating observed/missing data for patient-level diagnosis probability.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

### Summary

This patent exclusively addresses variant detection from sequencing data, focusing on accurate somatic mutation calling with very sensitive Bayesian classifiers and detailed filtering to remove false positives. It also provides novel benchmarking methods to evaluate variant caller performance. However, it fundamentally differs from Quant’s core innovation. Quant’s unique approach lies in genome-wide modeling of prior probabilities of pathogenic variants including inheritance modes, integrating observed variant calls and potential false negatives to compute Bayesian posterior probabilities of a *complete genetic diagnosis* with credible intervals. The patent’s usage of Bayesian classifiers is limited to variant-level error discrimination and somatic/germline classification, not to holistic diagnostic probability quantification at the patient-level. Therefore, despite some superficial overlaps in terminology (Bayesian classifiers, filtering false positives), there is no technical overlap with Quant’s unique theory or method of integrating TP, FN, and prior probabilities into a diagnostic confidence framework.
