#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Methods for more accurately determining tumor mutational burden (TMB) based on sequence read data for a sample from a subject are described. The methods may comprise, for example, receiving sample data comprising tumor purity data, variant data, variant allele fraction (VAF) data, or any combination thereof, for a sample from a subject; providing the sample data as input to a machine learning model configured to classify the sample according to TMB status based on the input sample data; and outputting a classification of the TMB status of the sample."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent use Bayesian/statistical frameworks integrating variant-level data into a diagnosis-relevant metric.
- The patent explicitly addresses estimation of TMB accounting for false negatives due to low tumor purity and variant allele fraction thresholds, akin to Quant's handling of unobserved variants and false negatives.
- Both integrate population-level and sample-level variant data (e.g., variant data, VAF, tumor purity) to infer a more accurate pathogenicity or disease-association metric.
- Use of machine learning models trained on variant calls in samples with sufficient purity to infer mutation/mutational burden status in samples with low purity or missing variants — similar conceptually to Quant’s integration of prior probabilities with observed TP and unobserved FN variant data.
- The patent claims include obtaining variant data (including short variants and rearrangements), mutational signature data, copy number alteration data, and digital histopathology data — with integration via ML models to classify or determine TMB status and confidence intervals.
- The patent explicitly aims to predict the probability of underestimated TMB — conceptually related to confidence/credible intervals on diagnosis certainty in Quant.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on tumor mutational burden (TMB) as a biomarker for cancer immunotherapy response — a disease-wide mutation load metric — rather than gene- or variant-level disease causality probabilities.
- Quant is genome-wide, gene- and inheritance mode-specific, focusing on disease-causing variant probabilities and Bayesian posterior probabilities of *diagnosis certainty* including credible intervals derived from population genetics (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) and variant observations.
- The patent leverages a large ML classification model trained to identify samples likely to have underestimated TMB due to technical or biological confounders, rather than explicitly quantifying per-variant or per-gene prior probabilities and integrating them into a Bayesian diagnostic confidence measure.
- Quant’s core novelty is modeling the probability distribution over TP, FP, TN, FN variant states with explicit integration of prior variant probabilities and sequencing coverage, while the patent, although it addresses false negative underestimation, focuses on ML classification of overall TMB status.
- The patent applies broad machine learning methods to classify or estimate TMB status, without a clear description of using true positive/false negative variant counts or probabilities structured as in Quant.
- Quant’s method explicitly integrates Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and inheritance modes, which are not addressed in this patent.
- The patent’s approach is tailored to somatic tumor samples with tumor purity metrics, focusing on detecting underestimation of TMB, a specific cancer biomarker, whereas Quant’s framework is broader, applicable to germline rare disease diagnostics genome-wide.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

While this patent involves machine learning to classify tumor mutational burden status and recognizes issues with false negatives due to low tumor purity, it does not explicitly embody the core Quant innovation of integrating prior genome-wide pathogenic variant probabilities with observed and missing variant data into a Bayesian posterior probability of a *genetic diagnosis*. The patent’s ML approach to TMB estimation addresses a related but distinct problem space (tumor mutational load vs. genetic disease variant confidence) and does not replicate Quant’s theoretical framework or Bayesian model involving TP/FN variant probabilities per gene and inheritance mode.

# Summary

The patent WO2024215498A1 discloses machine learning methods to detect and compensate for underestimation of tumor mutational burden in tumor samples with low purity, leveraging variant data, variant allele frequencies, and tumor purity. This is conceptually related to handling false negative variant observations. However, it does not structurally or theoretically align closely with Quant’s unique method of calculating genome-wide prior pathogenic variant probabilities, modeling the full TP/FN/FP/TN landscape explicitly, and computing a Bayesian posterior for diagnostic certainty of a patient’s genetic diagnosis. Therefore, it is assessed as not blocking Quant.
