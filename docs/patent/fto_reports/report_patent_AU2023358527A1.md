#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Described herein are methods and compositions for treating Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as compositions comprising a reelin-derived peptide and methods of use thereof."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both the patent and Quant deal with genetic variation and molecular mechanisms relevant to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease.
- The patent focuses on compositions comprising reelin proteins and variants (notably H3447R or H3447K mutations), mini-RELN constructs, and nucleic acids encoding such proteins, used to treat or prevent Alzheimer’s and related neurodegenerative conditions.
- The technology involves detailed molecular understanding of reelin’s role in neuroprotection, including interaction with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1), and modulation of tau phosphorylation.
- There is use of computational and experimental approaches (e.g., binding assays, NMR, SPR, BLI) to analyze specific amino acid mutations and their biophysical impact.
- The patent describes methods for gene editing (using CRISPR/Cas systems) to introduce specific mutations in RELN for therapeutic effects.
- The patent discloses mini-RELN fusion proteins designed to interact with receptors and GAGs to enhance reelin signaling, including modular domains such as signal peptides, oligomerization domains, receptor binding (R5-6), and GAG binding domains (Reelin C-terminus).
- Delivery methods include gene therapy vectors (e.g. AAV), mRNA, naked DNA, recombinant proteins, and microvesicles targeting brain regions (especially entorhinal cortex).
- The patent elaborates on providing quantifiable biochemical and pathological effects of these mutations and constructs on tau pathology, amyloid aggregation, and neuroprotection in both human cases and animal models.
- They provide extensive data on RELN-specific signaling pathways, effects on Dab1 phosphorylation, and reduction of tau hyperphosphorylation.
- The patent also contains detailed claims covering compositions, methods of treatment, gene editing, and diagnostic methods based on RELN mutations.

#### Key Differences

- The patent’s core focus is on therapeutic compositions and methods targeting reelin protein variants/mutations and their impact on neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease. It centers on manipulation of the RELN gene or protein products for treatment or prevention.
- Quant is focused on genome-wide variant probability modeling integrating prior probabilities and observed/missing variant data via Bayesian methods to output probabilities of genetic diagnosis. Quant does not target a particular gene, protein, or therapeutic molecule but provides a computational platform for variant pathogenicity and diagnosis confidence.
- The patent does not disclose or claim any probabilistic or Bayesian framework for variant classification or diagnosis confidence incorporating true positives, false negatives, or comprehensive genotype–phenotype probabilistic integration.
- The patent mainly addresses therapeutic intervention strategies (protein, mini-protein, nucleic acid delivery, gene editing) and molecular biology/biochemistry of RELN variants, not computational or statistical variant interpretation or diagnosis probability quantification.
- The use of Bayesian modeling or computing genome-wide probabilities integrating unobserved variant (false negative) data is absent.
- Although both involve genetic data and variant interpretation in the broad sense, the patent is not directed to diagnostic probability frameworks but to treatments and molecular biology of RELN in neurodegeneration.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

- The patent is directed to therapeutic methods involving reelin variants, their biological effects, and related gene-editing techniques for treating neurodegenerative diseases.
- Quant’s novel contribution is a scalable Bayesian platform integrating prior genetic probabilities with observed and unobserved data to output quantitative confidence in a genetic diagnosis.
- The patent neither discloses nor claims methodology conceptually or technically similar to Bayesian integration of true/false positive/negative data for genome-wide diagnosis probability.
- There is no meaningful overlap in core technical approach or purpose that would block Quant’s FTO.
- Terminology overlap in genetic and protein data is incidental and does not impact Quant’s freedom to operate.

# Summary

The examined patent relates to therapeutic applications of reelin protein variants and does not disclose or claim the computational Bayesian probabilistic framework for variant interpretation and diagnosis confidence that defines Quant’s core novelty. Therefore, it is **not blocking**.
