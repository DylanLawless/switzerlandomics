## Patent/Publication Analysis

### Reference #1

- **Title:** LOXHD1 Gene Mutants and Their Applications  
- **Publication No.:** CN112442528B

#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The gene mutation is a new related pathogenic mutation of non-syndromic deafness, and whether the biological sample suffers from non-syndromic deafness can be effectively detected by detecting whether the mutation exists in the biological sample."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent relates to identifying specific mutations (c.5331+1G>C and c.1973_2437+2del) in the LOXHD1 gene associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss.
- Provides methods, reagents, kits, biological models, and therapeutic agents based on detection or correction of these mutations.
- Involves biological sample testing for presence of the mutations via nucleic acid or polypeptide detection.
- Includes design and use of specific primers, probes, antibodies, and genetic constructs for detection and treatment.
- Covers diagnostic applications and screening methods to identify carriers or affected individuals.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on mutation identification and molecular diagnostic assays for a specific gene (LOXHD1) and specific mutations causing a monogenic recessive deafness.
- Does not describe or claim any method for calculating prior probabilities of pathogenic variants across the genome or genes.
- No mention of integrating population allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium modeling, or Bayesian posterior probabilities combining observed/missing variant data.
- Does not address quantification of false negatives or uncertainty in genetic diagnosis.
- No use of classification metrics such as true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), or a Bayesian framework to assess confidence in a genetic diagnosis.
- Claims pertain solely to detection and therapeutic use of specific LOXHD1 mutations, not to genome-wide probabilistic modeling or variant scoring frameworks.
- The patent’s diagnostic method is direct detection of mutation presence; Quant uniquely derives a probability measure quantifying confidence in a complete genetic diagnosis integrating prior and observed data probabilistically.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** This patent is narrowly directed to specific pathogenic mutations in the LOXHD1 gene and corresponding molecular diagnostic and therapeutic applications. It does not encompass or resemble Quant’s core innovation of calculating genome-wide prior probabilities, integrating population variant data, patient-specific variant observations, and missing data into a Bayesian posterior probability assessing overall genetic diagnostic certainty. The patent lacks the conceptual or methodological overlap involving TP/FN modeling or Bayesian confidence intervals central to Quant’s novel approach. Thus, it does not pose a potential freedom-to-operate barrier for Quant’s technology.
