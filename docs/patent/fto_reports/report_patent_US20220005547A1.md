#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Techniques for multiplexed droplet-based sequencing using natural genetic barcodes. An exemplary technique determining a unique variant combination associated with each subject from a plurality of subjects, determining a presence of a plurality of target variants in sequence reads grouped into partitions, and performing a sample demultiplexing and multiplet detection technique (demuxlet) on the sequence reads to: (i) remove sequence reads for partitions that are determined to be doublets based on a first statistical comparison of the unique variant combination associated with each subject and the plurality of target variants in the sequence reads, and (ii) assign a subject from the plurality of subjects to the remaining partitions remaining based on a second statistical comparison of the unique variant combination associated with the each subject from the plurality of subjects and the plurality of target variants in the sequence reads."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses a Bayesian/mixture likelihood model to assign sequence reads (from partitions such as droplets) to a subject based on unique variant combinations (natural genetic barcodes).
- Employs statistical comparisons leveraging genotype information over sets of target variants (SNPs) to demultiplex pooled samples by identifying the most likely donor of each partition.
- Detects and removes doublets (partitions containing nucleic acids from multiple individuals) by comparing likelihoods under mixture models.
- Organizes sequence reads by barcodes into matrices for analysis of variant presence.
- Maximum likelihood estimation is used to assign partitions to subjects based on variant overlap.
- Incorporates genotype quality and error modeling in likelihood computations.
- Integrates observed variant data to demultiplex and assign sample identity, accounting for ambiguous/multiplet partitions.

#### Key Differences

- Does **not** deal with variant pathogenicity classification or disease-causing variant probabilities.
- Focuses on demultiplexing sequencing data from pooled samples (e.g., multiplexed single-cell sequencing); does not provide genome-wide prior probabilities or gene-level disease probabilities.
- Does **not** integrate false negative or missing data probabilities related to variant detection for clinical diagnosis.
- Does **not** compute Bayesian posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis accounting for observed and unobserved variant data (no TP/FN modeling in a diagnostic context).
- Centers on identifying the source individual of sequence reads in pooled assays, rather than estimating disease risk or confidence intervals of diagnosis.
- Models genetic mixture at droplet/sample level for demultiplexing, not genome-wide disease variant burden or inheritance modes.
- The statistical models used are tailored for sample identification and doublet detection, not diagnostic certainty quantification.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

### Summary

The claims and disclosure of this patent focus on computational methods to assign sequence reads from droplet-based pooled sequencing experiments back to their respective donors, using natural genetic variants as barcodes. This involves likelihood-based demultiplexing and doublet identification but is unrelated to the problem of genome-wide probabilistic modeling of disease-causing variants and deriving posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis as implemented in Quant.

Quant's innovation lies in quantifying clinical diagnostic certainty by integrating prior variant probabilities, observed patient variant data, and false negative rates, enabling credible interval estimation of diagnostic confidence genome-wide. This methodology and its clinical diagnostic focus are not addressed or suggested by the patent, which is limited to technical methods for sample demultiplexing in sequencing data.

Hence, there is no substantive technical overlap in core methods or theory regarding genetic diagnosis probability modeling or TP/FN integration. The patent does not block Quant's key innovations.
