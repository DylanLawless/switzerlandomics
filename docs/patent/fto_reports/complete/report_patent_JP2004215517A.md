## Patent/Publication Analysis

### Reference #1

- **Title:** Alzheimer's disease-related gene, protein and their uses
- **Publication No.:** JP2004215517A
- **Publication Date:** 2004 (exact date unspecified)
- **Link:** https://patents.google.com/patent/JP2004215517A/en

#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention relates to a gene controlling the production of the amyloid β protein (Aβ) deeply involved in the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, the protein encoded by the gene, antibodies against the protein, diagnostic agents or medicines containing the antibody, screening methods for compounds effective for treating Alzheimer's disease, and kits for screening such compounds."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- The patent discloses genes and proteins that enhance Aβ production, particularly novel proteins (e.g. GATE-16 variant, GABARAPL1, PEN-2 homologs) linked to Alzheimer's disease pathology.
- Includes polynucleotides, recombinant vectors, transformants, antibodies, diagnostic agents, and methods of screening compounds that inhibit Aβ production.
- Employs expression of proteins in cells and screening for compounds altering Aβ production.
- Provides for antisense nucleotides, recombinant expression systems, and animal models for evaluating therapeutics.
- Focus on identification and use of novel genetic factors modulating amyloid β production, as diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on the molecular biology, identification, and use of new protein factors and their genes that promote Aβ production and their modulation for Alzheimer's disease treatment.
- The technical solution is to identify target genes and proteins, develop screening assays for inhibitors or antibodies, and provide diagnostic or therapeutic agents based on these molecular entities.
- No description or claim related to statistical or probabilistic modeling of genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants.
- No Bayesian integration of observed/missing patient variant data nor derivation of posterior probabilities of a complete genetic diagnosis.
- Does not address genome-wide variant probability estimation or quantifying false negatives in sequencing.
- Lack of emphasis on clinical diagnostic confidence intervals or quantitative probabilities of genetic diagnosis certainty.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Summary:**  
This patent is a biotechnology discovery and application relating to genes and proteins that influence amyloid β production for Alzheimer’s disease diagnostics and therapeutics. It does not disclose or claim methods involving genome-wide Bayesian modeling of variant pathogenicity probabilities or integration of prior variant probabilities with patient sequencing data to estimate diagnosis confidence, which is Quant’s unique innovation. The patent’s focus on molecular identification and screening is technically distinct and does not overlap with Quant’s probabilistic genetic diagnosis framework.
