#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention relates to a method for the diagnosis and/or classification of a disease in a subject based on the genetic and/or epigenetic information of a sample obtained from the subject, the method comprising the steps of: a) providing data from said sample, wherein said data comprises genetic and/or epigenetic information of a random subset of genomic positions; b) assigning said sample to a sample class based on genetic and/or epigenetic information of said random subset of genomic positions by employing a computational model, which discriminates a plurality of sample classes based on genetic and/or epigenetic information of a set of genomic positions comprising said random subset, wherein the computational model has been trained with pre-determined genetic and/or epigenetic information obtained from a plurality of pre-classified samples of known diseases and wherein said computational model processes the genetic and/or epigenetic information of a genomic position of said random subset independently of the genetic and/or epigenetic information of another genomic position of said random subset, wherein said computational model is preferably in the form of a linear classifier with independent feature sampling."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Utilizes a computational model trained on pre-classified samples to classify diseases based on genetic/epigenetic information of a random subset of genomic positions.
- Employs linear classifiers with independent feature sampling (including Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, or linear SVM).
- Processes sparse, shallow coverage data typical of nanopore sequencing, allowing classification based on random sequencing subsets.
- Incorporates Bernoulli and/or Poisson sampling assumptions to model binary or non-binary genetic/epigenetic states.
- Supports continuous data streaming classification updating as more data becomes available, enabling real-time diagnosis.
- Provides probability outputs relating samples to disease classes.
- Uses large-scale genomic/epigenetic data integration with no feature selection or reliance on fixed genomic marker panels.
- Applies machine learning optimized with class- and position-specific weights to improve classification accuracy.
- Designed for clinical use including intraoperative diagnosis and diagnosis from diverse biological samples.
- Employs Bayesian frameworks (e.g., Naïve Bayes) to compute likelihoods and posterior probabilities of disease classes based on observed genomic data events.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on classification of disease states/samples into discrete classes based on learned models from training data — essentially a multi-class or binary disease classifier.
- Does not describe a framework integrating prior genome-wide variant observation probabilities with observed/missing variant data in an inheritance mode-aware, gene-wise manner.
- The disclosed method does not explicitly address the integration of false negative probabilities or explicitly compute credible intervals quantifying diagnostic certainty as a Bayesian posterior for a **complete genetic diagnosis**.
- Focuses heavily on epigenetic patterns (e.g., DNA methylation) and classification from random subsets of CpGs rather than genetic disease-causing variant probability modeling under Hardy-Weinberg or inheritance mode models.
- The approach is not centered on variant pathogenicity probability aggregation genome-wide, unlike Quant.
- Emphasizes rapid classification of tumor types and other diseases rather than probabilistic estimation of presence or absence of a causative genetic variant in a patient.
- No indication of explicit True Positive (TP) / False Negative (FN) modeling of observed versus unobserved variants to compute a diagnostic confidence interval.
- No mention of genome-wide prior probability modeling under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium or aggregation of variant-level probabilities into gene-level/posterior diagnostic probabilities.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

**Rationale:** Although this patent shares use of Bayesian/linear classifiers with independent feature sampling and analyzes random subsets of genomic data, it focuses on disease classification based on genetic/epigenetic patterns without implementing the novel features of Quant. Quant’s unique innovation lies in genome-wide prior probability modeling of disease-causative variants, inheritance mode integration, explicit false negative modeling, and computing Bayesian posterior probabilities with credible intervals quantifying the certainty of a complete genetic diagnosis. This patent relates primarily to classification from sparse epigenetic/genetic data for diagnostic purposes, and does not address the core Bayesian diagnostic certainty and variant aggregation concepts fundamental to Quant’s novelty.

# Summary

- The provided patent relates to a Bayesian classification model for disease diagnosis based on sparse genetic/epigenetic data.
- Although it shares some superficial Bayesian and data sparsity aspects, it does not overlap with Quant’s core technology of genome-wide variant prior probability modeling, false negative integration, and posterior diagnostic probability calculation.
- Quant’s unique integration of observed/missing variant data with Hardy-Weinberg and inheritance considerations to produce actionable credible intervals comprising diagnostic certainty is not disclosed or suggested in this patent.
- Therefore, this patent is **not blocking** for the implementation or use of Quant.
