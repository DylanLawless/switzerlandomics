#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "Disclosed herein are ex vivo methods and compositions for treating sickle cell disease."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Use of ex vivo genetically modified hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/PC, specifically CD34+ cells) for treatment of sickle cell disease (SCD).
- Genetic modification targets an endogenous erythroid-specific enhancer sequence of the BCL11A gene to increase fetal hemoglobin (HbF) production.
- Use of zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), specifically a pair encoded by SB-mRENH1 and SB-mRENH2 mRNAs, to induce targeted mutagenesis within the BCL11A enhancer.
- Administration of a defined dose of genetically modified cells to subjects followed by myeloablative conditioning (e.g., busulfan) prior to infusion.
- Clinical endpoints include increase in HbF, decrease in SCD symptoms (e.g., vaso-occlusive crises), quality-of-life improvements, and reduction in transfusion needs.
- The method includes ex vivo delivery of ZFNs as mRNAs, cell modification, cryopreservation, and re-infusion.
- Detailed dosing regimens, harvesting (plerixafor mobilization), apheresis and manufacturing procedures, and clinical trial data demonstrating safety and efficacy.
- Evaluation of clinical biomarkers, disease symptoms, and genetic modification frequencies post-infusion.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses on therapeutic genome editing of HSCs to treat an inherited blood disorder by modifying a gene regulatory element (BCL11A enhancer) to increase therapeutic HbF, rather than on statistical or computational methods to quantify genetic variant pathogenicity or diagnosis confidence.
- There is no mention of quantifying prior probabilities of disease-causing variants, integrating observed and unobserved variant data, or deriving Bayesian posterior probabilities of genetic diagnosis.
- The core technical concepts are focused on genome editing methods and clinical treatment protocols, not on genomic variant probability modeling.
- Concepts like true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), or probabilistic diagnosis confidence intervals are absent.
- No overlap in computational frameworks, probabilistic models, or variant scoring theory as in Quant.
- The use of public variant data sets (gnomAD, ClinVar) and Bayesian variant interpretation approaches is not discussed.

#### Conclusion

Not blocking for Quant.

# Summary

The patent WO2023014839A1 discloses an ex vivo gene editing therapy for sickle cell disease using zinc finger nuclease-mediated knockout of a BCL11A erythroid enhancer to increase HbF, with extensive clinical development details. Although it shares the broad domain of human genetics and clinical genomics, the core technical approach, purpose, and methodology differ fundamentally from Quant's genome-wide Bayesian framework for quantifying disease-causing variant probabilities and diagnosis confidence. Importantly, there is no use or reference to Bayesian integration of prior variant observation probabilities with patient-specific variant data to compute diagnostic certainty as in Quant. The patent concerns therapeutic genome editing, not diagnostic variant probability quantification, and thus presents no material overlap in technology or blocking issue for Quant.
