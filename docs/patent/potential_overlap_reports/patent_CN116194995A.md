#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The genomic data analyzer may be configured to detect and characterize the presence of genomic instability in a tumor sample using a machine learning model, such as a trained convolutional neural network. Genomic data analyzers can use whole genome sequencing reads as input data, even at low sequencing coverage in high throughput sequencing workflows often employed in various clinical oncology settings. The genomic data analyzer may arrange the aligned read data coverage from the chromosome arms or whole chromosomes to form an array of coverage data signals, possibly in the form of an image. The trained machine learning model may process the coverage data signal array to determine whether chromosomal dimensional instability (CSI), such as genomic instability caused by homologous repair or recombination defects (HRDs), is present in the tumor sample."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Both Quant and this patent utilize genome-wide sequencing data, including low-pass or low-coverage whole genome sequencing (0.1X to 30X coverage).
- Both employ dividing the genome into blocks/tiles corresponding to chromosome arms and generating normalized coverage signals per block.
- Both arrange coverage signals into multi-dimensional arrays or "images" aligned along chromosome centromeres or telomeres for spatial pattern recognition.
- Use of trained machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to infer genomic instability or homologous recombination defect (HRD) status from spatially arranged coverage data.
- The patent discusses collapsing small coverage blocks (e.g., 100kbp) into larger blocks (~3Mbp) to reduce dimensionality but preserve spatial genomic structure, similar to Quant’s block collapsing approach.
- Incorporation of normalization steps, including GC content correction, to improve coverage signal quality.
- Artificial data augmentation strategies to enhance training datasets, including purity and ploidy adjustments, parallel data enhancement techniques applicable to Quant’s Bayesian integration framework.
- Application for clinical decision making, such as predicting tumor response to therapies including PARP inhibitors, aligning with Quant’s variant prioritization for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.
- The patent’s machine learning model outputs HRD scores or CSI scores and associated binary or multi-class classifications (HRD+, HRD-, indeterminate), paralleling Quant’s Bayesian posterior probabilities with credible intervals.
- The patent emphasizes low-coverage WGS combined with machine learning to identify chromosomal spatial instability, which conceptually overlaps with Quant’s genome-wide integration of observed and missing variant data to quantify diagnosis confidence.

#### Key Differences

- The patent focuses exclusively on detecting chromosomal spatial instability, specifically related to homologous recombination repair defects in tumor DNA, framed as a tumor genomics and oncology diagnostic tool.
- Quant’s central innovation is quantifying prior probabilities of disease-causing variants genome-wide, across all genes and inheritance modes, integrating true and false calls (TP, FN, FP, TN) into a Bayesian posterior probability of complete genetic diagnosis.
- The patent does not discuss evaluation or integration of variant-level prior probabilities from population allele frequencies or clinical variant classifications (e.g., gnomAD, ClinVar), nor does it address inheritance modes or rare disease gene panels.
- Quant explicitly models false negative probabilities for missed rare variants in sequencing and integrates observed variant data within a Bayesian framework to assess diagnostic certainty. The patent focuses on coverage signal patterns and machine learning classification of chromosomal-level instability, without explicit Bayesian integration of variant detection uncertainties or mode of inheritance models.
- The patent’s scoring is at a whole-sample HRD/CSI level, without per-variant or per-gene probabilistic outputs or credible intervals for variant pathogenicity or diagnosis confidence, which is a hallmark of Quant.
- Quant’s methodology extends beyond oncology and somatic tumor samples, targeting germline variant interpretation and rare disease diagnostics; the patent centers on tumor samples and cancer treatment stratification.
- The patent relies primarily on supervised and semi-supervised CNN classification of coverage signal images, whereas Quant integrates probabilistic prior-based modeling of variant observation and absence, which is mathematically distinct.
- The patent does not explicitly mention or utilize TP, FN, FP, TN frameworks to estimate variant detection certainty or diagnosis probability.
- Quant includes gene-level and variant-level integration using genetic inheritance models, which the patent does not address.

#### Conclusion

Potential overlap — recommend legal review.

While the patent addresses a different clinical application domain (tumor genomics for HRD detection) and does not explicitly incorporate Quant’s unique Bayesian integration of prior variant probabilities with observed/missing variant data using TP and FN constructs, the technical approach of generating spatially arranged coverage signal arrays from low coverage WGS and classifying chromosomal instability via machine learning, including CNNs, bears conceptual similarity.

Because Quant’s unique novelty lies in Bayesian modeling of variant observation probabilities and diagnostic confidence intervals rather than solely machine learning classification of coverage patterns, the overlap is limited but present in the domain of low coverage WGS spatial data analysis and use of CNNs.

Clear distinctions exist in scope and technical specifics, but the use of related spatial coverage data structures and machine learning models for genome-wide inference suggests a meaningful technical intersection that warrants careful legal consideration to assess freedom to operate fully.
