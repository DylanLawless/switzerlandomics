#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "The present invention relates to a system, method and computer program product modalities for determining the phenotypic impacts of the molecular variants identified in a biological sample... the modalities then determine molecular scores... determine molecular signals and population signals associated with the molecular variants based on the molecular scores... determine functional scores for the molecular variants based on statistical learning... determine the phenotypic impacts of the molecular variants based on the functional scores or evidence scores."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses molecular and population signals derived from high-throughput mutagenesis and cellular assays to generate functional scores associated with molecular variants.
- Applies machine learning/statistical learning (e.g., deep mutational learning, neural networks) to associate molecular signals with variant phenotypic impacts.
- Derives phenotypic impact predictions based on integrated molecular measurements from single cells or cell populations.
- Functional scores, evidence scores, and phenotypic impact classifications form the core outputs.
- Incorporates dimensionality reduction, unsupervised and supervised learning, neural network architectures (autoencoders, convolutional networks).
- Uses population signals, molecular signals, and phenotypic signals with statistical models for variant classification.
- Machine learning models trained on large datasets relating molecular-level data to phenotypic impacts.
- Characterizes variant function at high resolution with respect to molecular and cellular phenotypes.
- Analysis includes various genetic elements: coding/non-coding variants, multiple inheritance modes, and variant impacts.
- Extensive use of single-cell sequencing and barcoding to identify variants and associate them with functional phenotypes.

#### Key Differences

- **Scope and Focus:** This patent focuses almost exclusively on experimental and computational methods to characterize the phenotypic consequences of variants using deep mutational scanning and deep learning applied to cellular systems, including single cell multi-omic data.
- **No reporting of Bayesian integration with prior genotype probabilities:** There is no explicit disclosure of integrating prior population probability estimates (e.g., Hardy-Weinberg priors for genome-wide variant occurrence probabilities) with observed patient variant data and false negative rates to calculate a Bayesian posterior for complete genetic diagnosis.
- **No use of TP, FN, TN, FP formalism or diagnostic confidence intervals:** The patent is centered on direct functional classification and phenotypic impact prediction from molecular measurements rather than probabilistic modeling of diagnosis confidence that incorporates false negatives or missing variant observations.
- **Does not claim or describe estimating prior probability of disease-causing variants genome-wide across all genes and modes of inheritance and combining that with clinical variant observations for diagnosis confidence scoring.**
- The application is about scoring variant functional impact from experimental and computational integrative data, not about quantifying diagnostic certainty or probability of a true genetic diagnosis.
- Quant’s unique novelty is the Bayesian posterior probability model combining prior probabilities and observed/missing variants (including false negatives), which is absent here.

#### Conclusion

**Not blocking for Quant.**

The patent relates to deep mutational learning and phenotypic impact prediction of genetic variants primarily through high-throughput experimental assays and machine learning, focusing on functional impact classification. It does not disclose or claim the key innovations of Quant — specifically, Bayesian integration of genome-wide prior disease-causing variant probabilities with clinical observations and false negative modeling to estimate posterior probability and diagnostic confidence intervals. The theoretical and technical basis is substantially different from Quant’s approach emphasizing diagnostic confidence quantification rather than variant-level functional scoring alone.
