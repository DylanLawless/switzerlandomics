#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A method of fetal genotyping, comprises receiving maternal genomic DNA (gDNA) data, maternal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) data, and paternal gDNA data of a pair parenting to a fetus. The data are analyzed to identify a first set of sites at which the parents are homozygous for different alleles, and a second set at which at least one of the parents has a mutation. For each site of the first set, a probability that a respective portion of the maternal cfDNA data is derived from the fetus is determined. Each site of the second set is classified according to the determined probabilities as being either fetal or maternal to genotype the fetus."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses maternal cfDNA and parental genomic data to genotype the fetus noninvasively.
- Identification of sites where parents are homozygous for different alleles and sites with parental mutations.
- Determination of probability that a segment of maternal cfDNA is fetal-derived.
- Classification of sites as fetal or maternal for fetal genotyping.
- Bayesian procedure employed using prior probabilities derived from parental sequencing data.
- Use of fragment size distributions (fetal vs maternal cfDNA) to improve fetal fraction estimation and classification probabilities.
- Integration of read-level data and metadata, including multiple Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) parameters (e.g., template length, CIGAR strings, mapping flags).
- Application of machine learning (including deep learning) for recalibration and refinement of probabilities.
- Calculates posterior probabilities for fetal genotypes (e.g., 0/0, 0/1, 1/1) at variant sites.
- Genotyping includes single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions (indels).
- Outputs calibrated per-site confidence values.
- Employs a computational framework for genome-wide analysis.

#### Key Differences

- The patent’s technique focuses on fetal genotyping specifically in noninvasive prenatal diagnostics (NIPD) based on cfDNA fragmented in maternal plasma, which is conceptually distinct from Quant’s genome-wide prior probability platform aimed at clinical genetic diagnosis certainty.
- Quant calculates genome-wide prior probabilities of disease-causing variants under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, then integrates observed variant calls and false negative probabilities to derive Bayesian posterior probabilities of a genetic diagnosis—addressing diagnostic confidence, not just variant genotype assignment.
- The patent’s method is primarily concerned with classifying cfDNA fragments as fetal or maternal and assigning fetal genotypes at specific loci using read-level and fragment size information, often within clinical prenatal testing of single-gene or chromosomal abnormalities.
- Quant’s unique feature is quantifying diagnostic confidence including unobserved variants and credible intervals genome-wide, integrating population allele frequencies and pathogenicity annotations with observed patient data. The patent does not describe such genome-wide diagnostic certainty modeling or modeling of false negatives for comprehensive diagnosis probability.
- Although both use Bayesian modeling and deep learning, the patent applies these for fetal genotype calls from cfDNA mixture; Quant applies Bayesian integration combining population priors and observed variant/missing data to assess diagnosis certainty.
- The patent’s use of public databases or population allele frequencies is indirect (e.g., prior probabilities from parental genotypes), rather than modeling genome-wide disease-causing variant prior probabilities.
- The patent claims focus on fetal genotyping methods, systems, and machine learning recalibration for NIPD, not on general genome-wide genetic diagnosis certainty.

#### Conclusion

Potential overlap — recommend legal review.

**Rationale:** While the patent’s technology resides in the domain of fetal genotyping using Bayesian and machine learning approaches on cfDNA data and parental genotypes—there is partial conceptual overlap with Quant’s Bayesian framework integrating prior probabilities and observed/missing variant calls. However, Quant’s innovation focuses on genome-wide disease-causing variant probabilities and diagnostic confidence incorporating false negative modeling, which is not disclosed or addressed by the patent. The patent’s detailed technical implementations (e.g., SAM parameter use, fragment size binning, fetal fraction modeling, machine learning recalibration for fetal vs maternal fragment classification) partially resemble parts of Quant. Nonetheless, the purpose and scope differ significantly.

# Summary

- The patent WO2020049558A1 discloses a noninvasive fetal genotyping method that uses Bayesian modeling informed by fragment size distributions, parental genotypes, and read-level features to classify cfDNA fragments as fetal or maternal and to call fetal genotypes.  
- Quant’s novelty lies in genome-wide prior probability computation of disease-causing variants, integration with observed and unobserved variant data to estimate posterior probability and credible intervals of a genetic diagnosis—a broader diagnostic certainty platform.  
- The patent and Quant share Bayesian and machine learning methods, use of sequence read-level data and population variant information but apply these towards different technical ends—fetal genotype calling vs genome-wide diagnostic confidence estimation.  
- Given the overlaps in Bayesian integration and fragment-level probabilistic modeling, combined with differences in ultimate purpose and scope, a potential overlap with Quant exists, meriting detailed legal review.
