#### Abstract (excerpt)

> "A system is provided that considers allele fraction shifts as a function of copy number and clonal heterogeneity. The system leverages differences between allele frequencies to differentiate between somatic and normal variants in impure tumor samples... The expected allele frequencies can be calculated. The expected allele frequencies for somatic and germline differ with tumor content for different copy number alterations."

#### Relevant Overlaps

- Uses allele fraction modeling to distinguish somatic from germline variants in tumor samples without matched normal tissue.
- Incorporates allele-specific copy number estimation and tumor-cell fraction (clonality) to model expected allele frequencies.
- Employs Bayesian modeling to compute posterior probabilities that a variant is somatic, germline heterozygous, or homozygous.
- Uses iterative expectation-maximization to jointly estimate copy number states, clonal fractions, and variant classification.
- Models sequencing data using beta-binomial distributions for allele counts and Poisson for exon read depths.
- Applies classifiers (including quadratic discriminant analysis and machine learning) to distinguish true variants from artifacts.
- Integrates data across one or multiple samples from the same patient to improve somatic variant detection.
- Explicit consideration of false positives, false negatives, and credible intervals is implicit through probabilistic modeling.
- Partitioning genome into segments with at most one copy number alteration (circular binary segmentation).
- Uses prior probabilities derived from population databases (e.g., 1000 Genomes, COSMIC) for germline and somatic mutation frequencies.
- Models the impact of tumor purity and clonal heterogeneity on variant allele fractions.
- Reports variant-level and gene-level posterior probabilities and classifications.

These elements align closely with Quant’s innovation in integrating prior probabilities with observed/missing variant data, using a Bayesian approach to calculate posterior probabilities of pathogenic variants considering TP/FN scenarios, allele frequencies, copy number states, and tumor clonality.

#### Key Differences

- The patent is focused on somatic versus germline variant calling in tumor samples in oncology, whereas Quant’s description emphasizes genome-wide prior probabilities of pathogenic variants accounting for all inheritance modes (autosomal dominant, recessive, and X-linked), and aims at providing diagnostic certainty credible intervals for complete genetic diagnoses, including accounting for unobserved false negatives genome-wide.
- Quant highlights integration of multiple inheritance modes and broader genome-wide probability quantification, rather than focusing solely on somatic vs germline discrimination in tumors.
- The patent emphasizes calling variants in tumor samples with or without matched normal and includes machine learning classifiers mainly for artifact filtering, while Quant's emphasis is on combining prior genome-wide variant probabilities with clinical variant databases and observed patient variant calls into a Bayesian diagnostic certainty.
- Quant integrates prior genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and modes of inheritance, which is not explicitly claimed here.
- Quant explicitly outputs credible intervals of diagnostic certainty, which is not described in the patent.

#### Conclusion

Potential overlap — recommend legal review.

_Reasoning:_ The patent’s claims recite a Bayesian model integrating allele fractions, copy number, tumor-cell fraction, and prior probabilities for classifying variants as somatic or germline using expectation-maximization and beta-binomial models. This framework is very similar to Quant’s approach in combining prior probabilities with observed data (including TP and FN considerations) to derive posterior probabilities for variant pathogenicity in clinical diagnostics. Although Quant addresses broader inheritance modes and diagnostic certainty intervals, the core allele fraction modeling with Bayesian posterior probabilities and integration of prior data exhibits significant conceptual overlap requiring further legal assessment.
